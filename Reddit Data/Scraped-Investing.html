      <td>ARK Investment Management is looking to debut a new ETF that will focus on transparency in companies and shun vice and sectors that run afoul of ESG investing like fossil fuels.\n\nIn an SEC filing, Cathie Wood's shop outlines the fund, which looks to be at least 80% invested in stocks in its benchmark Transparency Index, published by Solactive.\n\n"Companies operating in the following industries, as determined by the Index provider, are excluded from the Index: (i) alcohol, (ii) banking, (iii) chemicals, (iv) confectionary, (v) fossil fuel transportation, (vi) gambling, (vii) metals, (viii) mineral, (ix) natural gas, (x) oil, and (xi) tobacco," ARK says in its filing.\n\nIf approved, the ETF would be the second that Ark has launched this year. In March, the company started a fund focused on space-related investments, which has risen about 4% since its debut and now has more than $600 million in assets. Meanwhile, the firm’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up to $22.5 billion, although it’s down 2% year-to-date -- compared with a gain of more than 20% for the S&amp;amp;P 500.</td>

(Nasdaq: OKTA\), the leading independent identity provider, today announced financial results for its second quart...)\nQ2 revenue grew 57% year-over-year; subscription revenue grew 59% year-over-year\n\nRemaining performance obligations (RPO) grew 57% year-over-year to $2.24 billion\n\nIncreases revenue and operating profit outlook for fiscal 2022\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, September 01, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Okta, Inc. (Nasdaq: OKTA), the leading independent identity provider, today announced financial results for its second quarter ended July 31, 2021.\n\n"In our first quarter as a combined company with Auth0, we're off to a fantastic start," said Todd McKinnon, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Okta. "Execution remained sharp with strong demand for Okta's workforce and customer identity solutions, as well as Auth0's developer-centric identity solutions. As organizations advance on their journey of improving their customers' digital experience, adopting zero-trust security environments, and deploying more cloud applications, they continue to turn to Okta to deliver an unmatched array of modern identity solutions to meet these challenges."\n\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2022 Financial Highlights:\n\nRevenue: Total revenue was $316 million, an increase of 57% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $303 million, an increase of 59% year-over-year. On an Okta standalone basis (excluding $38 million attributable to Auth0), total revenue grew 39%.\n\nRemaining Performance Obligations (RPO): RPO, or subscription backlog, was $2.24 billion, an increase of 57% year-over-year. Current RPO, which is contracted subscription revenue expected to be recognized over the next 12 months, was $1.10 billion, up 60% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021. On an Okta standalone basis (excluding Auth0), RPO and current RPO increased 42% and 43% year-over-year, respectively.\n\nCalculated Billings: Total calculated billings, net of acquired deferred revenue, was $362 million, an increase of 83% year-over-year. Calculated billings includes the effect of billings process improvements that were enacted at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding these changes, calculated billings would have been $345 million, an increase of 74% year-over-year. On an Okta standalone basis, excluding Auth0 and the effect of the billings process improvements, calculated billings increased 47% year-over-year.\n\nGAAP Operating Loss: GAAP operating loss was $263 million, or 83% of total revenue, compared to a GAAP operating loss of $45 million, or 23% of total revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nNon-GAAP Operating Income/Loss: Non-GAAP operating loss was $25 million, or 8% of total revenue, compared to non-GAAP operating income of $6 million, or 3% of total revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nGAAP Net Loss: GAAP net loss was $277 million, compared to a GAAP net loss of $60 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. GAAP net loss per share was $1.83, compared to a GAAP net loss per share of $0.48 in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. GAAP net loss and GAAP net loss per share include $150 million and $0.99, respectively, attributable to Auth0.\n\nNon-GAAP Net Income/Loss: Non-GAAP net loss was $16 million, compared to non-GAAP net income of $10 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share was $0.11, compared to non-GAAP basic net income per share of $0.08 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.07 in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nCash Flow: Net cash used in operations was $3 million, or (1)% of total revenue, compared to net cash provided by operations of $11 million, or 5% of total revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Free cash flow was negative $4 million, or (1)% of total revenue, compared to $7 million, or 3% of total revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $2.47 billion at July 31, 2021.\n\nThe section titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below contains a description of the non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables below.\n\nFinancial Outlook:\n\nOkta's financial outlook for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2022 includes the expected contribution from the acquisition of Auth0, net of purchase accounting adjustments. The acquisition closed on May 3, 2021.\n\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company expects:\n\nTotal revenue of $325 million to $327 million, representing a growth rate of 50% year-over-year;\n\nNon-GAAP operating loss of $35 million to $34 million; and\n\nNon-GAAP net loss per share of $0.25 to $0.24, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 153 million.\n\nFor the full year fiscal 2022, the Company now expects:\n\nTotal revenue of $1.243 billion to $1.250 billion, representing a growth rate of 49% to 50% year-over-year;\n\nNon-GAAP operating loss of $119 million to $114 million; and\n\nNon-GAAP net loss per share of $0.77 to $0.74, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 147 million.\n\nThese statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements safe harbor below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\n\nOkta has not reconciled its expectations as to non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain items are out of Okta’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share are not available without unreasonable effort.\n\nConference Call Information:\n\nOkta will host a live video webcast at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on September 1, 2021 to discuss the results and outlook. The news release with the financial results will be accessible from the Company’s website at investor.okta.com prior to the conference call. The live video webcast of the conference call will be accessible from the Okta investor relations website at investor.okta.com.\n\nSupplemental Financial and Other Information:\n\nSupplemental financial and other information can be accessed through the Company’s investor relations website at investor.okta.com.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\n\nThis press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, free cash flow, free cash flow margin, current calculated billings and calculated billings. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation, non-cash charitable contributions, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition and integration-related expenses, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs and loss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt.\n\nOkta believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\nThe principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by the Company's management about which expenses are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nOkta encourages investors to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.</td>

      <td>I'm a pretty casual investor. I check in a few times a month, sometimes less. I bought some TLND many years ago. I was checking the price recently, and noticed a very strange jump and plateau. I found out it was because it was in the process of getting acquired for a set price, and thus it plateaued at that price.\n\nNaturally I went looking in my account to see how it did, and I can't find it.  As I understand it, an acquired company stock turns into the stock of the acquiring company. That symbol is TBA, and I don't see it anywhere.\n\nAnyone have any insight what happened to it?\n\nAlso, I can't exactly ask my bank, since I have 3, and I forgot exactly which one it was.

      <td>For the past weeks ive been looking into choosing a moment to pick up Chinese tech stocks (Alibaba, Tencent etc) on the rebound. Now Ive found a post where they are keeping track of the Chinese tech narrative and it seems to be improving past few days. Have you ever used similar metrics in confirming or rejecting an investment thesis? And in this specific case?\n\nThe original plot ( [https://imgur.com/a/y5mX6HR](https://imgur.com/a/y5mX6HR)  ) and explanation (taken from original post, with permission).\n\n**Data**\n\nData consists of (financial related) headlines, tweets, chatter that is collected over time. This is a fairly large dataset (about 2 gb) that is updated daily.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nIve trained Neural Networks (Machine Learning) to recognize topics, emotions, sentiment etc in snippets of texts (headlines, tweets etc etc). Each snippet of text in the database gets assigned a score by being processed through these models. From here these scores are converted in to time series in order to see how emotions, narratives or sentiment evolves over time\n\n**What are you seeing in the plot?**\n\nThe plot is an excerpt from a dashboard ive build. It shows (stock market specific) sentiment towards China in financial headlines/tweets etc over time. The legend shows other metrics which are switched off for clarity reasons.

      <td>I   owned some shares of QTS preferred A series stock. When Blackstone    acquired QTS I assumed the stock would simply transfer to a new issue    via Blackstone. It appears instead that I simply am unable to trade the    shares I own, at least that's how it appears in my Fidelity account.   From the announcement today:\n\n&amp;gt;Following  the closing of its acquisition on August 31, 2021  by affiliates of  Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, Blackstone Real  Estate Income  Trust, Inc. and Blackstone Property Partners, QTS Realty  Trust ("QTS")  announced that holders of its 6.50% Series A Cumulative  Convertible  Perpetual Preferred Limited Liability Company Units (the  "New Series A  Preferred Units") will have the right, until the close of  business on  October 14, 2021, to convert each New Series A Preferred Unit into  $172.84 in cash. Thereafter, holders of New Series A Preferred Units  will have the right to convert each unit into $167.40  in cash. At the  closing of the acquisition, each outstanding share of  QTS 6.50% Series B  Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock was  automatically  converted into one New Series A Preferred Unit.  \nAdditional   information regarding the conversion is included in a notice of   occurrence of a fundamental change that has been distributed to holders   of New Series A Preferred Units. Holders who wish to convert their New   Series A Preferred Units should contact their broker, bank or other   nominee. Computershare is serving as the conversion agent and can be   contacted at c/o Computershare, Voluntary Corporate Actions, 150 Royall   Street Suite V, Canton, MA 02021 or \[redacted email\]\n\nIt  appears I should be able to convert the shares to cash but Fidelity  seems not to be able to handle that, at least not via the app. Does  anyone know the way to go about this?</td>

There are several reasons for this: 1, Fukushima and the associated reduced popularity of nuclear power; 2, oversupply of cheap uranium from nuclear weapons stockpiles during years of disarmament, this is not happening anymore and the stockpiles from this period are running low. **The current price of uranium is lower than the cost of producing in most mines.** The mines that can produce at or below the current price can not supply nearly enough to satisfy the demand of the nuclear power plants.\n\nSupply issues. 1, The low uranium prices has caused most uranium producers to reduce or entirely stop production, this includes the two largest producers in the world, Kazatomprom has reduced their production by 20% until 2023 ([https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Kazatomprom-extends-uranium-production-cuts-into-2](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Kazatomprom-extends-uranium-production-cuts-into-2)), Cameco has kept their McArthur mine closed since 2018 (this is the largest high-grade uranium deposit in the world). Starting up a mine that has been closed for years can take a long time (many months, maybe more than a year). **Most of the uranium mining companies that you will find on the stock market are not producing at all due to the current low price or uranium!** They know that uranium price have to rise and they can't afford to produce at the current price. Many companies will not even consider production until uranium reaches \~$65/lb; 2, covid caused further reductions in uranium production; 3, Due to the decade long uranium slump since Fukushima there are very few companies in the sector, 30-40 companies are involved in uranium mining, a resource responsible for 10% of the worlds electricity generation!\n\nDemand. 1, 10% of global electricity comes from ~440 nuclear powerplants, these powerplants need a reliable supply of uranium. Uranium is a minimal part of the cost of running a nuclear reactor, to the plant operators it does not matter that much if the uranium costs $30/lb or $100/lb; 2, Despite all the naysayers who think nuclear is dying, the demand for uranium is expected to increase for the foreseeable future. ~50 new nuclear plants are planned or under construction. Old reactors that were supposed to retire are having their lives extended. Many countries will not be able to reach their CO2 reduction goals without nuclear power; 3, due to the low price of uranium a lot of the former uranium producers are now buying uranium on the spot market and stockpiling it, they know that the current prices are a bargain and that they have to go up. 4, the US is establishing a uranium strategic reserve and plan to start buying up a total of $1.5-billion of uranium. 5, **Maybe the most important factor is the Sprott Uranium Trust that entered the market two weeks ago**. The Sprott trust was created to capitalize on the current situation, they plan to buy and hold uranium until the prices are significantly higher. Since they entered the market 2 weeks ago the uranium spot price has steadily risen by &amp;gt;10% and just reached its five-year high today ($34.63). Mind you, this is still very low.\n\nWhy should you care? The combination of supply and demand issues will cause the uranium price to rise. It just reached a 5-year high and I would be surprised if it does not reach $40/lb by the end of the year, it is reasonable to expect it to reach $65/lb in the next two years. \n\nSo, a doubling of the uranium price in a couple of years, what's the big deal you might say? Maybe you think your favorite investment is likely to more than double in two years?\n\nWell, turns out that most of the uranium companies (producers/developers/explorers) are heavily leveraged to the uranium price. If the uranium price doubles, most of the companies in the uranium sector are likely to much more than double, by how much depends on the company. In addition, many of the uranium bulls think that uranium prices might go much higher than $65/lb and maybe reach even higher than they did in 2007. In any case, there is money to be made in the next few years in uranium.\n\nRisks: 1, another Chernobyl or Fukushima would of course be bad news for the entire sector. However, the existing power plants still need uranium and the current uranium price is still too low, so it is possible that some gains will be maintained even with a bad accident; 2, Increased number of plants retiring. Some countries, e.g. Germany, are retiring all their nuclear power plants. If more countries follow suit it will over time reduce demand; 3, In theory it might be possible for producers to pick up the slack faster than expected and reduce the supply shortage and put a damper on the rise in the uranium price. So far, this does not seem to be the case, but even the low cost producers are limiting their production, and new or mothballed mines take time and resources to get up and running.\nSo, while there are risks, I think there is more than a good chance that we will see at least a doubling of the uranium price. \n\nThis is obviously not investment advice, I don't know anything about all of this and you should definitely do your own research. Personally I'm invested in a bunch of different uranium companies: DNN, GLATF, CCJ, PALATF, CVVUF, STTDF. And I plan to continue buying if there are any dips and maybe start buying into the Sprott Uranium Trust as well (SRUUF). Oh yeah, the plan is for SRUUF to get listed on the NYSE this fall, that should hopefully bring in a lot more money into buying physical uranium and continue to drive up the price.</td>

      <td>I figured this would be a relevant post considering an article that recently came out: [SEC Chairman Says Banning Payment for Order Flow Is 'On the Table'](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sec-chairman-says-banning-payment-for-order-is-on-the-table-51630350595?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D15870954255182272650222902245108134425%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1630371926)\n\n**Disclaimer:** **I'm simply condensing some thoughts I've had on payment for order flow (PFOF). I'm just a casual observer, and this is the internet. For all you know everything I'm about to say is complete BS.**\n\nPayment for order flow =/= front running (which is already illegal). Nothing I have seen or experienced leads me to believe that PFOF screws over retail investors in any meaningful way.\n\nMight you get better fills if you use a brokerage that doesn't participate in PFOF? Sure. Does it matter? No, at least not for the vast majority of retail investors. If you're in that *tiny* (probably non-existent) minority where your bottleneck to greater profits is fill quality, then you probably wouldn't consider yourself an investor, and probably aren't reading this post.\n\nThink about it: If you bought AAPL a month ago, does it really matter that your order *technically* might not have filled at the best possible price? What if you only DCA into SPY? If you were gambling in penny stocks or options having no idea what you were doing, is PFOF the deciding factor of your P/L? No. **Isn't it great that we can do all of these things without worrying about paying commissions?** I think so.\n\nEven if you *could* get better price improvement from a broker not participating in PFOF, you're still never going to do worse than the [NBBO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp).\n\nIt used to not be very clear to me *why* market makers are willing to pay so much for retail order flow. Then I read [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/hnkiaz/why_is_this_subreddit_so_popular/fxbzcx3?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3) and [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/hnkiaz/why_is_this_subreddit_so_popular/fxcfrlc?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3) from someone who implies they are a market maker, and the light bulb went on. Here are the highlights:\n\n&amp;gt;...  \nwe literally buy up your order flow and make pretty good money off of it because you guys genuinely have no clue what you're doing  \n...  \nin aggregate your orders are effectively random noise that we can trade against to make a small spread  \n...  \nIf I'm market making, I'm putting a bid at price B, and an ask at price B + S for some S &amp;gt; 0. I am hoping that someone will sell to me at price B and buy from me at price B + S, so that my profit on such a pair of transactions will be S, the spread.  \n...  \nSo anyways one guy, Joe, has his fancy indicator X signal to buy stock XYZ and shortly thereafter another gal, Jane has her fancy indicator Y signal to sell stock XYZ. The ad-hoc nature of many of these "indicators" is that most of them will not be correlated with one another and in aggregate will mostly average out to some fraction of S.  \n...  \nSo if I know that there's a group of unsophisticated traders on stock XYZ, I want to trade against them in aggregate compared to trading against a sophisticated trader who may actually know what they're doing.  \n...  \nThe remaining risk in the above strategy is that XYZ can have actual legitimate signals such as news that causes the price to swing heavily in one direction or another, so usually when market making you find a basket of stocks that are delta neutral.\n\nThis makes the most sense out of anything I've ever read about PFOF.\n\nIf I'm a market maker and it's *literally my job* to be transacting in the market *all day every day*, and my goal is to make money from the bid/ask spread, I don't want to be exposed to any other source of P/L. The best I can hope for is to take opposing trades to as many orders as possible whose P/L will average out to 0. I'll make the spread times however many round trip trades that I've taken.\n\nNow let's look at front running.\n\nHere's what FINRA says about front running ([rule 5270](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/5270)):\n\n&amp;gt;No member or person associated with a member shall cause to be executed an order to buy or sell a security or a related financial instrument when such member or person associated with a member causing such order to be executed has material, non-public market information concerning an imminent block transaction in that security, a related financial instrument or a security underlying the related financial instrument prior to the time information concerning the block transaction has been made publicly available or has otherwise become stale or obsolete.\n\n...English translation ([source](https://www.sec.gov/rules/other/f4-433/mccann1.htm#:~:text=Front%2Drunning%20occurs%20when%20portfolio,same%20securities%20for%20their%20clients)):\n\n&amp;gt;Front-running occurs when portfolio managers buy securities in their personal accounts prior to buying the same securities for their clients, or when the managers sell securities out of their personal accounts prior to selling the same securities for their clients.\n\nIf I want to make money by front running, I want to see a lot of large, one-sided orders, and get in on *the same side* as those orders before they're executed (remember a market maker will always take the *opposite* side). When they go through, and the market moves to that side, I'll make money.\n\nIt seems like a bad idea to try and front run retail flow, given its smaller average order size and uncorrelated nature. Retail flow probably won't be moving markets in most cases.\n\nObviously the whole GME/meme stock situation might be different, but maybe not. Here is an interesting point that was made in [a thread](https://www.nuclearphynance.com/Show%20Post.aspx?PostIDKey=200252&amp;amp;PageIndex=2) on NuclearPhynance:\n\n&amp;gt;I can't speak for GME, but in similar conditions, you'd really be surprised just how non-toxic the order flow turns out to be. Especially on a short-term basis. A lot of the real flow winds up being near random and totally insensitive to the spread, unaware of its own impact, and uncorrelated with microstructure alpha. Obviously, that's all great for market makers.\n\nI will leave you with a link to [an interesting post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mb1dx3/brokerages_list_by_payment_for_order_flow/) that outlines what brokers charge for PFOF.</td>

The company has environmental standards that are designed to protect the environment and prevent or otherwise minimize, mitigate and remediate the impacts of their mining activities in the mining sites’ locations. They also involve the local communities, providing jobs and provisioning local goods and services, which makes them become an important player in catalyzing the economic development and social well-being of host governments and communities.

They also put a priority on using locally sourced products and services whenever practical, to benefit the regional economy. Also, the company has an environmental management project with the goal of minimizing the impact of mining on the environment. This is also more possible since the current president of Ecuador vowed to emphasize the enforcement of environmental protection rules and larger involvement from indigenous communities in deciding the future of mining projects.\n\nSomehow, a lot of corporations feel less responsible for the damage they cause to the environment and to communities with their projects, so I think it should be the responsibility of these companies to change and be more inclusive and responsible.

For instance, to assess stocks profitability, Return on Assets (**ROA**), Return on Equity (**ROE**) and **Net Margin**  are taken into account. The algorithm looks up the value of ROA in  every stock belonging to the same industry and compares it against the  analyzed stock, providing a final rank: if there are 20 stocks and 5 of  them have higher ROA, then the ROA-associated score is (20-5)/20 \* 100 =  75, meaning that the ROA is better than in 75% of stocks. We want ROA  to be higher than in the other companies; sometimes, however, we want to  be lower than in peers, as is the case with Price to Book ratio (**P/B**).  Then, the mean score across ROA, ROE and Net Margin is calculated.  Similar with Valuation, Growth and Health scores. The algorithm starts  with Valuation score, requiring it is at least 50/100. Then it proceeds  with Profitability, Growts and Healts scores, each time requiring the  score to be 50 or higher. Finally, for the remaining stocks the mean  value across all four areas of interest are calculated. Only highest  ranking stocks are the ones of interest and subjected to further manual  inspection.\n\n\n\n### Disclaimers\n\n* What you see here is my personal opinion and should not be treated as investing advice\n* I’m not an expert stock analyst nor financial advisor\n* I’m not associated with any of the sources cited\n\nMichał, the Investing Scientist.</td>

      <td>India is probably a country that is under-invested in, and probably for good reason, but Paytm, which Berkshire Hathaway, Softbank, and Alibaba have large stakes in, is the most promising IPO I have seen.\n\nIt competes with many companies but has large, 65%-70%, marketshare. The company is doing I believe $500 million in revenue this year and hoping to double that by 2023. It's in a region that has staggering payments growth; huge, not comprobable to the US right now, and I'm thinking where china was a few years ago.\n\nI'm hoping the IPO doesn't get too big; and it may not since IPO market has not been that crazy last few months compared to other times. The company projects $25-$30 billion ipo. That's an okay deal; not great but not terrible. If it's $50 billion+ then it may go the way of Facebook or flat-line for a few years.  If it's anything like Paypal, or Square however, and all signs point to it being something similar yes, then an invstor can reap huge returns over 10-15 years if shares can be picked up in the $20 billion range.</td>

      <td>I'm looking for diversification of my portfolio to be somewhat resilient w.r.t. crashes. As usual, I'm writing a bit of a preface before coming to the point.\n\nAs probably most investors are, I'm currently mainly invested in stocks, mostly several ETFs. I'm planning to rebalance soon, so I'm re-thinking how exactly. I'm -- compared to most recommendations -- currently a bit heavy on US stocks because it went so well in the last years so the position is larger than it was. I'm a bit heavy on Europe, but that's kind of on principle since I'm located there and like to be a bit Europe-heavy, and I'm certainly too low on rest of the world and Emerging Markets. I have a little bit in Government Bonds and Corporate Bonds, but that's not too much.\n\nNow, everyone will agree at some point there will be a crash. So do I, but as everybody who is honest to themselves I have no idea when. Could be tomorrow, could be some point in the next year, could be in a couple years, could be in 10 years. I simply don't know, I'm not a fortune teller. If I knew when a crash will happen things would be very easy: Sell everything, go short, and buy again after the crash.\n\nBut what I do know is that when there is a crash, it's good to have some money to buy. I could set aside some war chest in cash and just wait. But that money will be slowly eaten by inflation and certainly not increase in value.\n\nIf I were to invest some of the money in other asset classes other than stocks, ideally some which would not go down the same as stocks in a stock market crash, I could gain some value, and when the crash comes just rebalance the extra cash I have there to stocks after the crash for added benefit.\n\nIf you think about it, that's diversification across asset classes. I've read a bit on Google what people recommend there, and here's a breakdown of possibilities, and my opinion on them:\n\n* Government bonds (US and the stable European ones). The good news is they are not so correlated to the stock market. In fact, for the 2007/2008 crash, they've done very well. For the 2020 crash, they fell rapidly as well, although not as much as the stock market. They give some interest, but it's certainly very limited. Seems a bit better than just holding the cash, but not much. Also, if I'm investing in US government bonds (which pay better interest than e.g. German bonds) I have the currency risk. I could hedge that, but that would cost a bit of the meagre profit...\n* Commodities/precious metals. I don't get that one. I understand that some of them might go up in a crash. But they don't generate any interest by themselves, it's pure speculation. An ounce of gold is just the same ounce of gold in 10 years. Under a lot of assumptions I could say that it might be a hedge against inflation and thus better than holding cash. But it's nothing that will provide any returns beyond inflation by just passively investing.\n* Real Estate (direct investment). It's a shitload of work, it's very risky since it's hard to diversify unless you have a lot of cash to invest there. I don't want that.\n* Real Estate (through REITs or Real Estate stocks/ETFs). Much easier to realize, but questionable how much it helps with diversification. The Real Estate ETFs all went down pretty much the same as the stock market last year, and while not many of them existed, the 2007/2008 crash was caused by real estate, so I don't expect this to have been very resilient (but I'm looking into whether the problem here is that weighting by market-cap might be a bad idea here...). This might be an asset class a bit more robust than the overall market, but I am skeptical. On top of that, I'm shocked about the dividend rates here, I expected a lot of them to be much higher. Adding a bit of that is likely fine.\n* Tune weighting of industries/regions based on their performance in the last years. With that, I mean thoughts like: US stock market went extremely well the last years, so if there should be a crash, it has the biggest possibility to fail -&amp;gt; have less US. Consumer Staples and Energy did worse than the market the recent years -&amp;gt; more of those, since they won't fall as much in a crash. Tech stocks went exceptionally well, so they have the most potential to fall -&amp;gt; less of those. This will mitigate the risk (although I'm skeptical on the Energy part), I guess, but also limit growth for the current market situation.\n* Cryptocurrencies. Surprisingly high correlation to the stock market if I look at the charts. They crashed last year. Also, they're pretty high right now and their intrinsic value is a bit questionable. I'm not completely against investing a small portion of my portfolio there, but I'm not overly convinced of this. If they had a clear negative correlation, it would show that they are regarded as an alternative when the traditional market fails. But I can't see that being the case right now.\n* P2P lending. I'm skeptical. It's completely unregulated, so there's counterparty risk. It's hyped a lot by influencers, which rings alarm bells. And if I look at bondora, which seems to have shifted the focus to their "Gain&amp;amp;Grow" product, that gives 6.75% per year, but has a 1% withdrawal fee and a 400 EUR maximum investment per month, this looks fishy. This industry also had trouble last year, with withdrawal restrictions and higher default rates, so its resilience in crashes is also questionable. It's its own asset class, but lack of transparency and regulation make me be very hesitant here.\n\nHow do you diversify your asset classes? With what reasoning?</td>

      <td>Tldr let PE multiples trigger a rebalance into value. \n\nThoughts?\n\nDid some quick analysis on S&amp;amp;P 500 PE ratio. Current PE is not a good measure due to 2020 earnings but the estimated earnings for 2021 are 205 which puts sp500 around 22 times earnings\n\nI'll take 2010 earnings of 89 and bump it up to 90 for best case analysis. Assume way above average earnings growth of 7.2%. For 11 years to get us to 2021. How much am I willing to pay for earnings if recent average is 16 times earnings with 19 being the extreme? 20 of course. I'm a long term investor. \n\nI'll divide by 10 because I'm looking at spy. \n\n90×1.072^11 × 20÷10 = 386\n\nOk. We should be here. Earnings are much higher than expected due to the stimulus. \n\nIf we take current record earnings with a 20 PE the extreme shouldn't be at 450 until roughly 2 years from now. \n\nEnd of this year plus 1.5\n\n205×1.072^1.5 × 20 = 4,550\n\nHere's the strategy:\n\nWhen I see earnings multiple rise to these heights I move from something like SPY to VTV. Value. \n\nThe percentages can be customized for risk tolerance but that's the general idea. Let PE trigger a rebalance.\n\nAn example portfolio may be SPY 80% QQQ 20%. Add to and hold for a decade. Notice the sky high multiples, move all QQQ into VTV. Move half of spy into VTV. Keep adding to SPY QQQ in the same 80/20 ratio even though you're buying high, doesn't matter. Hold and add for another decade and watch as PE come back to normal either through mind blowing earnings or prices drop.\n\nEither easy you've protected your earnings and can weather a correction.</td>

      <td>Basically my question is in the title -&amp;gt; "Is Peer to Peer Lending a Viable Alternative to the Stock Market?" \n\nBut now I'm going to write a bunch of stuff elaborating on this point, as there is a minimum for submission on this subreddit. Please enjoy!\n\nI am wondering, with great curiosity, if anyone here (or there) has tried online peer to peer lending services. I would like to know about your experience. Perhaps, if you were so bold, you may also venture to remark about your return on investments. Of course I do not mean to pry. Simply, I am l seeking for anyone (and everyone) with experience with something like Peerform, Upstart, Funding Circle, Prosper, Payoff, or any other similar platform offering similar services and potential benefits.\n\nMore specifically, should I need to clarify, what was your general experience with this investment?\n\nHow long have you held this investment?\n\nWere there any major problems? \n\nWere there any surprises?\n\nWere you filled with joy?\n\nOr..\n\nDid this investment break your heart?\n\nAnd most ever importantly, and not to be forgotten, (as it is the center of the debate) I mean to propose once again and beg your audience and ask with great earnestness, \n\nIs Peer to Peer Lending a Viable Alternative to the Stock Market? \n\nPlease feel free to further elaborate by agreeing or very possibly (although I will presume no more likely) disagreeing.\n\nPerhaps we can even get a rousing bout of fisticuffs going here regarding one of the finer points you chance to provide. Of course, I mean this most figuratively. Certainly you are a person of great character and eloquence.\n\nFrom what I can gather, assess, and understand, it appears that one might very well expect up to an 8% return annually on these such investments -or indeed much more! This sounds a bit far fetched, and quite frankly, dubious to me. \n\nThere certainly must be some risk, or pitfalls if you will, that I'm not aware of or fully appreciating. Of course there is always the risk of the borrowers not repaying what was lent to them in the first place. I would think this would be of paramount concern. \n\nSo if you have lent using this service, I ask you, has the issue regarding repayment and the potential for delinquency and/or if not down right dereliction of prior obligations, been of such a substantive issue that you, your person, have had to deal with negatively in any magnitude of order or capacity?</td>

      <td>Hi all,\n\nI am financial professional I have never traded outside of simple fidelity brokerage and 401k funds/etfs. I however am very interested in playing around with the historical stock market data set. I’m not taking about individual company fundamental research but rather factor research at the market level. I want to be able to see the entire data set of publicly traded stocks with all associated data, (multiples, std dev, beta, sharpe etc.. etc etc etc, as well as monthly returns. ) as well as all technicals . \n\nI want to be able to sort by this thing and then filter for the other thing.  See what happens if I take the the highest xyz multiple stocks and then filter for only ones who have x% earnings growth over the last Z years, and then sort the resulting pool by blah blah blah. \n\nI want to make hypotheses about technical trading strategies and then back test them. To get more on the weeds, I want to run regressions of returns against various random factors just as an act of learning and exploration of buy and hold quantitative strategy development .  I know how to do regressions on excel but what I don’t know is how to find all the historical data that I want.  \n\nI just want to be able to fully explore all the available data, both technical and fundamental, for the entire market, in an excel style worksheet, and use it to come up with hypothetical strategies, for fun, and maybe in the future for more. \n\nThen I would also like to backtest the strategies that I come up with as a learning tool. \n\nI am a CFA so I have the knowledge and expertise to work with and understand the data but I don’t know how to actually source the data and what the proper tools are for doing this type of work. \n\nLike, say I wanted to start a quant shop, what tools would I need to begin researching formulating my hypothesis? I have this urge to play with all the historical data but don’t know the best venue to do it. \n\nWhat tools should I use to get started? How can I track moving averages for value versus growth over rolling 3 month periods and compare and contrast and then filter for certain range of multiples in a certain sector blah blah. I just want to start playing with it all but I am not familiar with the tools. \n\nI mean, I have experience with a Bloomberg terminal and Morningstar but I feel like that’s insufficient. I guess I just want to know what the industry is using for this type of research.</td>

      <td>Why is there so little talk about platinum as a place to store wealth? You hear people talking about gold and silver so much more.  Is it because it corelates closer with the economic cycles because it is used more for production while gold and silver are better hedges against stocks and market downturns? Or is it more so because the price has been cut in half over the past decade so no one is talking about it? Does anyone know how this compares to around 2010 when platinum was at $2000 per oz?\n\nFrom what I understand about platinum is it is scarcer than gold and harder to mine as well.  I've always wondered and it's even hard to find any news/information about it.  \n\n\nEdit: From the little I know about gold and platinum, I believe gold is also used for electronics which is a growing industry and platinum is used in automotive industry, which is being disrupted by electric vehicles. That could also be a reason for the decline. Just thought I'd add this to the discussion</td>

      <td>&amp;gt;[Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN) is getting into the buy now, pay later space.  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;The e-commerce giant is partnering with [Affirm](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AFRM) for its first-ever installment payments option on the popular e-commerce site.  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;Affirm’s buy now, pay later checkout option will be available to certain Amazon customers in the U.S. starting Friday with a broader rollout in the coming months, the companies said in a statement. The partnership will let Amazon customers split purchases of $50 or more into smaller, monthly installments.  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;Affirm’s stock spiked as much as 48% after-hours Friday on the news, adding more than $8 billion to its market capitalization, later settling up around 33%. Amazon shares were unchanged.  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;Friday’s partnership is the latest sign of the booming lending space as younger consumers move towards these alternative lines of credit. Earlier in August, Square jumped into the space with a $29 billion [deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/02/square-to-buy-australia-fintech-afterpay-amid-buy-now-pay-later-trend.html) to buy Australian fintech Afterpay.  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;So-called installment loans have been around for decades, and were historically used for big-ticket purchases such as furniture. Online payment players and fintechs have been [competing ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/10/pay-later-is-booming-with-a-wave-of-companies-launching-installments.html)to launch their own version of “pay later” products for online items in the low hundreds of dollars.  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;Affirm is one of the best known installment payment options. It works with more than 12,000 merchants, including [Peloton](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PTON) and [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT).  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;[PayPal](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PYPL), Klarna, [Mastercard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MA) and Fiserv, [American Express](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AXP), [Citi](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/C) and [J.P. Morgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM) are all offering similar loan products. [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL) is planning to launch installment lending in a partnership with [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GS), Bloomberg reported last month.  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;Affirm said some of the Amazon customer loans will bear interest, but some will come with 0% APR.  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;“By partnering with Amazon we’re bringing the transparency, predictability and affordability that Affirm provides today to the millions of people who shop on Amazon.com in the U.S.,” Eric Morse, Senior Vice President of Sales at Affirm, said in a statement. “Offering Affirm’s alternative to credit cards also delivers more of the payment choice and flexibility consumers on Amazon want.”\n\n[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/27/amazon-partners-with-affirm-for-first-buy-now-pay-later-option.html)</td>

      <td>Hi Everyone, I think I finalized my growth &amp;amp; income portfolio and I'm interested to hear what you all think. I have a 50/50 split but with a caveat. On the growth side I have VTI, VT, &amp;amp; SCHG. On the dividend side I have QYLD, SCHD, and DIVO. Both SCHD and DIVO are a mix of growth and dividends. So really the split is more like 65% growth and 35% high yield dividends with QYLD.\n\nI know the consensus is to focus on growth until retirement but I want to have the dividends as supplemental income along the way, not just for retirement. I backtested this portfolio and it was able to track back to Jan 2017. The account balance doubled in 4.5yrs and I'm happy with that. I also compared it to a portfolio of 100% VTI and the VTI portfolio only had an extra 3% growth in 4.5yrs.\n\nThe portfolio has an overall dividend yield of 5% using the allocations below.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n|Symbol|Allocation|Description|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|VTI|10%|Total Market US|\n|VT|10%|Global Market|\n|SCHG|30%|US Large Cap Growth|\n|QYLD|35%|High Dividend Yield|\n|SCHD|10%|Dividend + Growth|\n|DIVO|5%|Dividend + Growth|</td>
