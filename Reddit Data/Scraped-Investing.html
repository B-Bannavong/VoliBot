Before the trade I had $32,000 margin buying power with about $11,000 non margin buying power on Friday. I made a purchase for about $8600 worth of stock X shares. Today my margin buying power is at a negative -$ 8,000 and non margin at a negative -$2,400. It’s clear that my cash buying power was used because I have $2,400 left to withdraw from the account. So why does the system spazz out even though I didn’t even use margin for the purchase and have over $20,000 equity in the account.

      <td>Edit:  I just want to note upfront, I'm not advocating you go out and buy Uranium miners or trust/futures etc.  My purpose is to share what I think is an interesting study in reflexivity / market behavior.     \n\nThere's something funky going on in the Uranium market. On the 17th of August, Uranium prices started climbing, and they've been climbing every day since.  Interestingly, nothing of note around nuclear power has come out since then.  Just rising Uranium prices and analyst upgrades for mining companies.  Feel free to correct me if you know otherwise.\n\nFor some background, there's been a perpetual shortage of Uranium production in the world. The total stockpile of uranium has been falling for over a decade straight.  \n\nCoincidentally, the [Sprott Physical Uranium trust launched an at the market equity program on the 17th](https://sprott.com/investor-relations/press-releases/sprott-physical-uranium-trust-launches-at-the-market-equity-program/).  When premiums to NAV get too high, they sell more shares, which they are then obligated to spend any raised capital on acquiring uranium.   \n\nI think that there shelf program is, literally, moving the market.  Uranium is a relatively small and illiquid market.  [Total annual uranium production is in the neighborhood of 130MM pounds.](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/uranium-production-figures.aspx)  Consumption is about 25% higher than that.  Sprott [lists](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/) their uranium stockpile on a daily basis.  As of Thursday the 2nd, they had 21.8MM pounds of Uranium.  Checking the Wayback machine, they had 19.8MM on Wednesday the 25th.  That's an increase of 2 Million pounds in 8 days, or 250,000 lbs per day.  Daily global production is only ~375,000 lbs.  **Sprott's trust has bought 67% of global uranium production over the last week**.  Volumes are accelerating, and it's possible their buying rate will increase going forward.  \n\nI think we could be witnessing the beginnings of a  reflexive process here.  Higher uranium prices will attract more speculators, pouring more capital into the speculative acquisition of uranium needed by utilities, further driving up prices.  \n\nTLDR:  The Sprott Uranium Trust has bought 75% worth of the world's Uranium production over the last week, and judging by the volume, it's accelerating.  \n\nDisclaimer:  I'm long $SRUUF.\n\nFor maximum Alpha: buying popcorn and watching the ensuing shit-show is risk free.</td>

      <td>These accounts vary in restrictions depending on jurisdiction, but essentially the main commonalities are limited ability to position short (long puts only), and no direct access to margin. \n\nOff the top of my head :\n\n1) Buying deep ITM calls (eg buy a SPY 250 call, it costs approx half of SPY and returns the same dollar change but a larger percentage)\n\nDownsides : often high cost of leverage (like 5% premium to asset value), limited time horizon - if you bought march 2020 spy 250 calls for leverage a year prior you may have lost it all, while stock holders did not see any expiry\n\n2) Buying levered instruments (3x daily etfs)\n\ndownsides : volatility drag, liable to blow up in a 2008 style crisis, expense ratio\n\n3) Buying mutual funds or other funds that use leverage on your behalf (eg PSLDX) \n\ndownsides : expense ratio, limited transparency for some, often illiquid and difficult to enter or exit on short time scales\n\n4) Borrowing money (eg line of credit, refinance mortgage) to contribute to your tax advantaged account \n\ndownsides : you can lose more than just your investments(bank can come for your assets), might be screwey with contribution limits to tax advantaged accounts\n\nAre there any other methods i'm missing?

      <td>\n\nWhen it comes down to sizing the global online gambling market, “all bets are on.” Grand View Research says it will grow 11.5% to $127.3 billion in 2020-2027, while The Business Research Company predicts an increase of 10.4% to $92.8 million in 2019-2023. With these estimates, gambling stocks –including those of online casinos– are roaring up.\n\n## Online Gambling Growth\n\nIt was a tough last couple of years for brick-and-mortar casinos. The American Gaming Association reports that all commercial and tribal casino properties in the U.S. closed during Covid lockdowns, with tiers 1 and 6 operating between 24% and 50% capacity upon returning to operations. \n\nHowever, with this reactivation and the technological advances of online betting, the gambling industry is back with a bang and has become one of the fastest-growing businesses on the planet.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey, the online gambling market has reached 1.6 billion people, reigniting an industry that has seen a dramatic transformation through new technology. \n\nPlay Today says that at least 80% of Americans gambled in the past year, as users rushed to online casino directories like Canada Casinos to crash the website, looking for some blazing betting fun.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the business not only grew in size but also witnessed some eye-catching movements in online gambling stocks, with companies like DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) soaring after its 2020 IPO.\n\nAlso, “MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) launched its mobile betting app BetMGM in partnership with Roar Digital, LLC,” Insider Monkey Reports.\n\n## Stocks On The Rise\n\nThis year, 12 states in the U.S. will legalize sports betting spreading the impact to online gambling platforms. With this outlook, the famous site Gambling.com going public under the “GAMB” ticker, with a price per share estimate of 8$ –although down from $11 to $13.\n\nThe company controls more than 30 websites in 13 countries, and hit nearly $28 million in revenue in 2020 and $11.5 million in the first quarter this year.\n\nAnother attractive stock option within the online gambling market is Penn National Gaming Inc (NASDAQ: PENN), which was mentioned in the second quarter investor letter of Baron Funds.\n\nThe letter said: “Following a 232% gain in 2020, the shares of Penn National Gaming, Inc. declined 29% in the most recent quarter and are down 13% year-to-date. At its recent price of only $73 (down from a peak price of $136 in March), we believe Penn’s shares are now attractively valued.”\n\nThe casino firm is based in Pennsylvania boasting an $11.1 billion market capitalization. “PENN delivered a -17.98% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 32.73%. The stock closed at $70.84 per share on August 13, 2021.”\n\n## Brick-And-Mortar\n\nAmid the economic comeback, brick-and-mortar casinos are also on the way up. According to Truist analyst Barry Jonas gave Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) a Hold rating “and increased its price target from $43 to $38.”\n\nThe vaccine rollout is likely to exert a positive effect on these stocks, coupled with the company’s solid earnings and optimistic forecast.\n\nInsider Monkey reports that “In the first quarter of 2021, Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) had an EPS of $0.68, short on estimates of $0.85. The company’s net revenue decreased 15.6% or $1.20 billion from the previous quarter.”\n\nAs for Caesars Entertainment Inc (NASDAQ:CZR), the casino leader saw a solid EPS of $2.03 in the first quarter, up from $1.80. Its revenue during the same period hit $1.7 billion, an increase of 259.2% versus the last year. “Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) has gained 131% in the past 12 months and 27% year to date.”\n\nSource - [https://ceo.ca/@jwolinsky/casino-stocks-are-sizzling-after-fierce-covid-downturn](https://ceo.ca/@jwolinsky/casino-stocks-are-sizzling-after-fierce-covid-downturn)</td>

      <td>(Disclaimer: I am from the U.S.) Hi r/investing folks, first time poster here. I find that investing in quality foreign companies via ADRs can be a good way to generate alpha as there are fewer eyeballs on these sort of names. I typically only invest in ADRs with good liquidity as some trade fewer than 1k shares per day. That said, what are your favorites? I can give you a couple of mine: \n\nADYEY (Adyen N.V.) - Major fintech/payment gateway, on the level of PayPal, Square, and Stripe. From what I've read, Adyen services large multinational companies (vs. Stripe which focuses more on startups). These companies have great business models with strong network effects and a long runway for growth. A lot of people know about PYPL/SQ/Stripe already and I think Adyen flies a bit under the radar in comparison. \n\nEVVTY (Evolution AB) - Supplier of live casino services, allowing customer-facing online casinos the ability to offer real-time gameplay. Maybe you have heard of some of these burgeoning online casinos; Roobet and Duelbits are just a couple of examples. Despite the capital-intensive nature of building a live casino (setting up studio, hiring dealers, server costs, etc.), Evolution is able to spread this cost over its customer base, providing a cheaper option than what customers would be able to develop in-house. The stock may suffer over the short term as in-person casinos reopen, but longer-term I see a significant opportunity for Evolution to dominate the live casino space (with +60% EBITDA margins to boot). \n\nSo, what are you're favorite foreign companies/ADRs? Would love to hear a couple sentences showcasing your thesis (though if you just want to post a bunch of tickers, that's fine as well haha).</td>

      <td>Although everyone has sort've silently moved on, AMC is still trading steady at $45. (\~500% gain from last year) GameStop is sitting steady at $200. (\~2000% gain). Ethereum is growing rapidly and currently sitting at nearly $4000 (\~2000% gain). The most popular NFT (CryptoPunks) have grown from $4000 last year to roughly $400,000.  That is a roughly 10,000% gain. I think you get the point.\n\n"Value" stocks like Ford and GM have gone up about 50% in the same time, a fraction of the growth stocks. Similarly, these value plays dropped 40% during the coronavirus crash, roughly the same as all risky assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.\n\nWhich poses the question :: why would anyone buy stocks, especially value stocks?\n\nEverything Buffett and others eschew have provided the most returns in the past 5-10 years. Now while one may have been focused on value and long term growth, their returns will have been essentially rooted to their peers who invested in growth. (ironic to call an unproductive asset like crypto "growth" but you get the point). So in logical times, you could say "these are in a bubble and history does not repeat itself to the future." however, considering the past 5 years crypto is up tremendously with little dips and currently sits at a $900b mc (btc), it could also be another 5 years it goes to $2t before it goes back down. So "the long run" point is vague and meritless.\n\nInvesting has certainly changed from 100 years ago when Intelligent Investor was written, though obviously many of the principals still apply, how do you adapt?</td>

      <td>[**Read the full article here**](https://www.ft.com/content/e870dd10-223c-411e-9e72-53c3b8e609b6)\n\n&amp;gt;Evergrande has warned it risks defaulting on its debt if it fails to raise cash, as China’s most heavily indebted property developer battles to stave off an unfolding liquidity crisis.  The unusually stark wording from the company came in an interim earnings statement on Tuesday that confirmed a profit warning issued last week and outlined a series of measures to shore up its finances that include selling properties.  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;“The group has risks of defaults on borrowings and cases of litigation outside of its normal course of business,” Evergrande said, adding that it would pursue further asset sales, control costs and seek to attract new investors.  The warning comes as Evergrande experiences the worst upheaval in its history, with a stream of recent problems raising questions over its access to financing, forcing it to sell assets and earning it an unusual public rebuke from the government over its debt risks....\n\nFor those not aware, Evergrande is the largest real estate developer in the world. And it's arguably the largest real estate developer in the largest real estate bubble in the world.\n\nI'm sharing this because ***if*** this were to default, it could be a trigger for some much larger market turmoil. Evergrande represents potential systemic risk both in China as well as the global financial markets. IE, this defaulting ***could*** be a bit of a Lehman-esque type moment.\n\nWith that out of the way, I want to be very clear - **\*\*this is NOT likely to default\*\*** since the strong likelihood is that it will get a bailout due to the system wide risk attached to it for China. Edit: and also just to add, China controls a lot of levers in their economy that you would not see in western free markets. This can potentially prevent things from spiraling in a negative manner.\n\nWith that being said, history has a lot of examples of policy mistakes, or attempts to control asset bubbles that simply end up popping the bubble. I stated this a few months ago, but the current attempt from Chinese policymakers to control debt and reduce economic risk is a tightrope walk, and there are legitimate risks of overtightening. With that said, China has a LOT of control over all the levers in their financial system, so if any country would be able to stop a cascade, it's likely China.\n\nThe result is that this is more likely to be a bottom for Chinese markets assuming it gets a bailout. But there is a small tail chance that the complete opposite happens and things really fall apart. Since that chance is larger than normal (but still not large) and the magnitude of effects are enormous if it were to occur, it's something that's worth at least being aware of.\n\n**Note:** Please at least try to refrain from making this into an ideological or political debate about China.  Given, sometimes these things merge into the financial realm of discussion, but at least try to take a neutral view of this.</td>

      <td>I've been trying to get into the cybersecurity and data privacy industry because of it's monster growth projected over the next decade (CAGR of 9% and 41.5%, respectively). Sadly, it seems I'm a little late to the party because every company I've seen is ridiculously overvalued imo. I'm not usually a stickler for high valuations, but these guys are on another level. \n\nZS has a P/S of 61.66, DDOG has 54.21 P/S, NET has a whopping P/S of 72, and CRWD has a whopping 53 P/S and 15 PEG.\n\nThe only one I can see that seems relatively okay is PANW with a forward P/E of 63, a P/S of 10, and a PEG of 2.32. not amazing, but I can see how it could outperform.\n\nI know these numbers don't mean everything, and there are other reasons why I believe they are overvalued, but I have never researched an industry that consistently had this high of valuations compared to sales. Yes, some of these guys are growing 100% YoY consistently, but that'll still take years for them to grow into their valuations, assuming their prices stay stagnant until then.\n\nIs this just a symptom of the industry right now, or are there some genuinely good buys in Cybersecurity or data protection that have ground-level valuations? \n\nAnd just to get ahead of it, please don't blatantly shill or do any FUD in the comments.</td>

      <td>Pretty self explanatory. You may not believe things will go down, and if so it’s not my intention to argue — I’m familiar enough with investing to know value stocks will win if held in the long run and I understand we’re in the greatest bill run in history BUT I can’t help but see breaks in the dam. I’m looking to make money when things go down. \n\nMostly concerned with:\n\n1. Exorbitant P/E ratios fueled by aggressive buybacks — inflates stock price without adding any tangible assets to companies \n2. Powell had no room to lower rates, we’re at the bottom, when we go up it will massively affect business lending and many low-margin businesses won’t be able to stay around without massive price increases \n3. Inflation isn’t transitory. Now that money velocity is returning to pre-pandemic levels we are seeing inflation everywhere. It’s not just cars. Unless there’s more lockdowns you restrict spending, you can calculate CPI anyway you want and it will continue to climb \n4. The reverse repo market is super sketchy and more banks are participating\n\nYou may not agree with any of this and believe the bull market will continue forever, but I believe we’re back in the pickle faced by Carter and will need to boost interest rates to combat inflation at which point a great majority of small companies will fold — and largely inflated P/E ratios will fall resulting in a catastrophic loss of market cap on Wall Street.\n\nIf you think this is possible, or heck even if you don’t, humor me and let me know how you’d invest. I’ve got some shares of FAZ, SPXU, and UVIX because they seem to have blown up when interest rates racheted up in fall of 18 and I expect a similar performance when the fed realizes it can’t print its way out of the PE bubble it’s created. \n\nThoughts?</td>

      <td>Disclosure: I currently own 26,000 shares of Zen.v at a $2.9 CAD cost-basis, writer of the article also retains a long position on the stock at hand.\n\nI have shared write-ups on this specific stock many times on other subreddits, My initial position was taken back in April, with many purchases since then.\n\nEdited down from a **SeekingAlpha** article for brevity's sake. Full article is very detailed and a recommend to read fully.\n\n**Short term Risks:**\n\nHC Approval. In the short term, it’s all that matters effectively. This company has many opportunities not discussed here, so the long term view is quite bright. In other words, the face mask and PPE market opportunity is a launch pad for the even larger opportunities that will come later. Thus, if HC approval does not come through-\n\n(more questions that delay things beyond, let’s say a month or 2, or worse, an outright rejection – neither of which is expected, but can't be known with regulators until it becomes public, which is why getting approval is a MAJOR de-risking event for the company)\n\n\-then expect the stock to have a rough time of it. On the other hand, if they get approval... This company is in what Stan Druckenmiller has described as “Inning 1.” If for some reason, HC does not grant approval and bless it as anti-viral and biocidal, but leaves the door open, then the stock steps back and it will be Stan’s Inning 0, as long as HC ultimately grants approval.\n\n**Investment Thesis:**\n\n***ZEN Graphene Solutions Ltd.*** **(OTCPK:ZENYF) (ZEN.V)** has a major catalyst ahead of it with the decision of Health Canada as to the safety and efficacy of its game-changing biocidal, anti-viral and anti-microbial AgGO-2 mask coating.\n\nRisks are in favor of approval, which would be a major de-risking event, causing a rapid and significant (roughly 100%+) re-rating of the stock. For those less inclined to await approval, the intermediate and longer term upside would remain significant, even from those levels, giving a pre-approval *risky* investment or a significantly less risky post-approval investment.\n\nThe business model is extraordinary (discussed below), so if the company executes anywhere near plan, this will be a hyper-growth company that will be a "must own" over the next few years as the Graphene industry develops.\n\n**An IP Play on an Innovative Nano-Material, Not a Mining Company:**\n\nZEN was a mining company. It is now an IP nano materials play (“graphene-enhanced” technology). The company recently announced it is asking shareholders to approve a change to their industry status with the stock market and that it will seek to move to a bigger exchange, hopefully in the US. The company has a graphite deposit which is at the development stage, which costs very little to maintain for now and which won’t be mined for many years, if ever. I expect de minimis expenses for the deposit for the foreseeable future.\n\n**Three Initial Target Markets:**\n\n*Prevention, Detection and Treatment*\n\n1. Personal Protective Equipment ("PPE," e.g., masks, gowns, caps, booties, nitrile gloves (hospitals and restaurants, etc.) and Air Filtration (e.g., HVAC filters),\n2. Detection/Sensors (e.g., game-changing rapid, inexpensive and high accuracy COVID testing, with other tests behind that, such as STDs (a huge and rapidly growing problem), certain types of cancer and other diseases/viruses) and\n3. Therapeutics - both topical and ingested, but that's longer term in nature due to regulatory hurdles and could be tremendous, but let’s leave that for another time. In addition, there are many other potential applications, such as fuel additives to improve efficiency, paints to reduce ice on plane wings, and countless other applications.\n\n**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**\n\nZEN’s first market will be the application of its formula to surgical and other masks. The effect of their formula is innovative and game-changing: it is to be applied on an additional layer of mask, which essentially grabs the particle (the formula is hydrophilic) when it hits the mask (either coming at the wearer or from the wearer) and then render it harmless.\n\nThe next PPE application will be for nitrile gloves. Given the tremendous threat posed by MERSA, alone, it seems logical that the company’s customers ultimately also will apply ZEN’s formula to surgical caps, gowns and booties.\n\n**Air Filtration, Air Conditioning Filters:**\n\nThis is an enormous market, with various industry reports reporting it in the many billions of dollars. That’s when things are “normal” (i.e., pre-COVID). If the mask market is a company-maker, the A/C filtration market is a barn burner. There are millions of office buildings in the US and Canada.\n\nThere are over 6,000 hospitals.\n\nThere are over 21,000 nursing homes and elder care facilities.\n\nThere are airports, airplanes, trains, subways, restaurants, theaters, malls - all are high traffic, often densely packed and require the best quality filters on the market.\n\nAnd all are desperate for solutions to create a safe environment to bring back business.\n\n**Detection and Sensors:**\n\nThe company’s product (separate from the AgO-2 solution) provides next generation rapid, saliva-based antigen detection. In about 8 minutes and at very low cost per test, according to the company, the product uses a patent-pending DNA aptamer that recognizes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein simply through a saliva test.\n\nImagine going to an indoor concert today with 1000s of other people packed in in close proximity and no masks? What if for something like a $10 ticket surcharge, you could arrive at a pre-assigned time (let's say an extra 10-30 min early, depending on the size of the venue and number of entrances), get tested, have a highly accurate answer in 8 min, and then go in to the concert, free of concerns that the 100s of people anywhere near you and the 1000s in the auditorium have COVID.\n\nPlease see the company’s presentation for more details: [ZEN Graphene Solutions](https://www.zengraphene.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021_08ZEN-Investor-Presentation.pdf). The solution appears to be scalable, accurate (making PCR tests look awful) and has the added benefit that aptamers can be adapted to be used for many diseases, well beyond COVID. It's a tremendous market opportunity for the company that cracks this nut and also a very high margin business.\n\n**Therapeutics:**\n\nDown the road, the company is looking to enter the therapeutics market, including both topical and ingested applications. Management believes this market opportunity may be even larger than the aforementioned markets. As these take time to enter and will not drive revenue in the near-term, but also won’t cost much to pursue in the short term, I’ll address them at a later time.\n\n**The Model:**\n\nThe company has initiated a pilot line and is producing roughly 1 million masks per day (1M mpd). The company is also building out a 25M mpd facility nearby their offices that is scheduled to begin ramping production in Nov. The same coating should be applied to many different use cases, so the company thinks about sales in “masks equivalent” (“me”). For instance, if a typical industrial air filter is 3m x 3m (my slightly educated guess), that would require roughly 100me.\n\n**Margins:**\n\nAssuming GM north of 80%, given that graphite (the underlying commodity) is cheap and plentiful, we’re talking about a nano-material, so very small quantities are required relative to output and revenue.\n\n**OP's Note:** They are currently purchasing Graphene-oxide from a third-party to fullfill production, but anticipate a scaling-up of in-house production over the next year. Price of purchase is proprietary according to Exec. Dir. but claim that their studies of the material they are purchasing fit the bill for the mask-coatings.\n\n**Expenses:**\n\nExpect the company to be running at about $300K per month in opex, which already allows for running the new facility since most of it is automated machinery. Per [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiNxl9nMuZ4) Aug. 11th, opex was $200K/month, but given what the Chairman recently said on a public [investor](https://zoom.us/rec/play/o0pa1AWvr7JeqA8NB9eYv-msGZT6lyORYdfPNtQv0WsGV_xBAQeWx9kktlZAAW3_atTsk3TGZEAB3q1J.f6gqjOS0h0D6ZxTw?continueMode=true&amp;amp;tk=BC-G9Hc3b6WfHM3UmFy3BtwyvR54zN_0CLWXDs2uJ94.DQMAAAAWnR6e9RZvMncxdTZNNVJwbVBlNDBFNUlkV1Z3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&amp;amp;uuid=WN_Mt_sG54lRg2JoK-vzA8ctA&amp;amp;_x_zm_rtaid=LzQDuI2dSS2ES6R-FeKTXQ.1629297669865.7b102740d4e41e5d6637da3088f7c22a&amp;amp;_x_zm_rhtaid=39) call, they’re hiring at least a few heads.\n\nFor the sake of conservatism, assume that given the massive ramp in revenue and profitability, they’ll end up spending more than that, so double their current opex number to $400K.\n\n**Capex:**\n\nAssume capex will be around $5M-ish, a good bit of which already has been spent. Regardless, the number is so low as to be inconsequential if the company is generating the kind of cash flow, it will, given their current cash position of something just over $4M plus a bit more than that amount in warrants, many of which are in the money and some of which have acceleration clauses; roughly $8M-ish+, all in, vs a very low burn rate.\n\nObviously, since they’re only beginning to ramp and generate revenue, there is a wide range of profit possibilities. Based on what co has said: Assuming the company makes something toward 4c/mask, based on what would be a conservative assumption, which is using the lower end of the midpoint of the revenue per mask the company mentions in its presentation, which you can review, as noted, above.\n\nLet’s say that at some point in 1H:2022 they’re selling out the 25M mpd. That’s:\n\n25M mpd equivalent x .04 = $1M/day in revenue\n\nx 80%+ GM = $800K/day GP (all numbers in Canadian Dollars)\n\nx 30 days/mo = $24M/mo GP -$400K/mo opex (using low end of what management has said)\n\n= $23.6M EBITDA per month x 12 months = $283.2M EBITDA / year -27% tax rate = $206.7M in Net Income /99M shares (fully diluted) = C$2.09 annualized run rate EPS (approx. $1.66 in USD)\n\n(the company has a $30M NOL that will reduce this on first earnings)\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n\nWith $4M in cash and more than that in in-the-money warrants, some of which have accelerator clauses, the Company doesn’t need capital. Assuming they get HC approval, are generating meaningful rev and cash flow and want to improve the company’s public profile, I could definitely see this Street-savvy management team raising capital opportunistically.\n\nI’m okay with that: a company that doesn’t need to raise money won’t be forced to do so at unattractive prices, like so many small cap companies. A company growing rapidly with their business accelerating and a long runway will have investors clamoring to get in at scale, so deal terms should be very attractive for all parties involved. Since they don’t need money, they can be opportunistic about whether and at what price they might consider a deal.\n\nIf they continue to hit milestones, any such deal would only be done at multiples of the current price. (Yes, I know that sounds like every other small cap dream, but if you dig into this one, you’ll see it’s quite rational.) Anticipate that the company will seek uplisting on the US markets later this year if Sep 27th shareholder vote passes through.\n\n**Misc:**\n\nLock-up expiration behind us: There was a deal in the spring. The lock up expiration is now well behind us (early Aug).\n\n**Insider Buying:**\n\nThe CEO recently bought 50,000 shares (over $100,000) in the open market. He's already the largest shareholder, owning about 4% of the company. I see this as a vote of confidence in ZEN's prospects of winning HC approval.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n* ZEN is an IP play with a strong management team and an outstanding business model and is creating game-changing “must have” products, rather than “nice to have” ones.\n* ZEN makes an innovative, proprietary, patent pending silver graphene oxide (AgGO-2) formulation at the nano-scale that will be applied to various materials for many applications.\n* Revenues should start very soon, incremental margins should be very attractive and the company should be profitable and CF+ imminently, *possibly* earning their market cap within a year.\n* If things play out according to base case, the stock should trade at a minimum of C$40+ within 12-24 months, returning well over 10x.\n* ZEN potentially has a very long and steep growth trajectory that could last a very long time. This is the best idea I've seen in years.</td>

      <td>ARK Investment Management is looking to debut a new ETF that will focus on transparency in companies and shun vice and sectors that run afoul of ESG investing like fossil fuels.\n\nIn an SEC filing, Cathie Wood's shop outlines the fund, which looks to be at least 80% invested in stocks in its benchmark Transparency Index, published by Solactive.\n\n"Companies operating in the following industries, as determined by the Index provider, are excluded from the Index: (i) alcohol, (ii) banking, (iii) chemicals, (iv) confectionary, (v) fossil fuel transportation, (vi) gambling, (vii) metals, (viii) mineral, (ix) natural gas, (x) oil, and (xi) tobacco," ARK says in its filing.\n\nIf approved, the ETF would be the second that Ark has launched this year. In March, the company started a fund focused on space-related investments, which has risen about 4% since its debut and now has more than $600 million in assets. Meanwhile, the firm’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up to $22.5 billion, although it’s down 2% year-to-date -- compared with a gain of more than 20% for the S&amp;amp;P 500.</td>

(Nasdaq: OKTA), the leading independent identity provider, today announced financial results for its second quarter ended July 31, 2021.\n\n"In our first quarter as a combined company with Auth0, we're off to a fantastic start," said Todd McKinnon, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Okta. "Execution remained sharp with strong demand for Okta's workforce and customer identity solutions, as well as Auth0's developer-centric identity solutions. As organizations advance on their journey of improving their customers' digital experience, adopting zero-trust security environments, and deploying more cloud applications, they continue to turn to Okta to deliver an unmatched array of modern identity solutions to meet these challenges."\n\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2022 Financial Highlights:\n\nRevenue: Total revenue was $316 million, an increase of 57% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $303 million, an increase of 59% year-over-year. On an Okta standalone basis (excluding $38 million attributable to Auth0), total revenue grew 39%.\n\nRemaining Performance Obligations (RPO): RPO, or subscription backlog, was $2.24 billion, an increase of 57% year-over-year. Current RPO, which is contracted subscription revenue expected to be recognized over the next 12 months, was $1.10 billion, up 60% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021.

Calculated billings includes the effect of billings process improvements that were enacted at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding these changes, calculated billings would have been $345 million, an increase of 74% year-over-year. On an Okta standalone basis, excluding Auth0 and the effect of the billings process improvements, calculated billings increased 47% year-over-year.\n\nGAAP Operating Loss: GAAP operating loss was $263 million, or 83% of total revenue, compared to a GAAP operating loss of $45 million, or 23% of total revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nNon-GAAP Operating Income/Loss: Non-GAAP operating loss was $25 million, or 8% of total revenue, compared to non-GAAP operating income of $6 million, or 3% of total revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nGAAP Net Loss: GAAP net loss was $277 million, compared to a GAAP net loss of $60 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. GAAP net loss per share was $1.83, compared to a GAAP net loss per share of $0.48 in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. GAAP net loss and GAAP net loss per share include $150 million and $0.99, respectively, attributable to Auth0.\n\nNon-GAAP Net Income/Loss: Non-GAAP net loss was $16 million, compared to non-GAAP net income of $10 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share was $0.11, compared to non-GAAP basic net income per share of $0.08 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.07 in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nCash Flow: Net cash used in operations was $3 million, or (1)% of total revenue, compared to net cash provided by operations of $11 million, or 5% of total revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Free cash flow was negative $4 million, or (1)% of total revenue, compared to $7 million, or 3% of total revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $2.47 billion at July 31, 2021.\n\nThe section titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below contains a description of the non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables below.\n\nFinancial Outlook:\n\nOkta's financial outlook for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2022 includes the expected contribution from the acquisition of Auth0, net of purchase accounting adjustments. The acquisition closed on May 3, 2021.\n\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company expects:\n\nTotal revenue of $325 million to $327 million, representing a growth rate of 50% year-over-year;\n\nNon-GAAP operating loss of $35 million to $34 million; and\n\nNon-GAAP net loss per share of $0.25 to $0.24, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 153 million.\n\nFor the full year fiscal 2022, the Company now expects:\n\nTotal revenue of $1.243 billion to $1.250 billion, representing a growth rate of 49% to 50% year-over-year;\n\nNon-GAAP operating loss of $119 million to $114 million; and\n\nNon-GAAP net loss per share of $0.77 to $0.74, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 147 million.\n\nThese statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements safe harbor below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\n\nOkta has not reconciled its expectations as to non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain items are out of Okta’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share are not available without unreasonable effort.\n\nConference Call Information:\n\nOkta will host a live video webcast at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on September 1, 2021 to discuss the results and outlook. The news release with the financial results will be accessible from the Company’s website at investor.okta.com prior to the conference call. The live video webcast of the conference call will be accessible from the Okta investor relations website at investor.okta.com.\n\nSupplemental Financial and Other Information:\n\nSupplemental financial and other information can be accessed through the Company’s investor relations website at investor.okta.com.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\n\nThis press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, free cash flow, free cash flow margin, current calculated billings and calculated billings. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation, non-cash charitable contributions, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition and integration-related expenses, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs and loss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt.\n\nOkta believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\nThe principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by the Company's management about which expenses are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nOkta encourages investors to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.</td>

      <td>ESG Investing is a relatively new (compared to most other types) of investing strategy.\n\nCompanies that have generated high ESG scores  (when analyzed right) have proven to outperform other companies in their sector **over the long term.**\n\nESG analysis is thorough and when done right is not surface level. The high ESG is essentially a scoring that communicates a company's ability to be more sustainable, environmentally friendly and operate in a more work place friendly culture and so these companies tended to weather economic storms (so to speak) better than their counterparts. **Over the long term**.\n\nTherefore,  the financial incentive is that a high ESG score is associated with decreasing cost of capital. Why? They are deemed to be a less riskier asset class. They may not generate absolute return returns but they are stable and steadily increasing.\n\nSo we have ESG Funds popping up, and Asset management firms are hiring ESG Analysts - Governing bodies and other public entities as well etc. etc.\n\nSo why do so many consider ESG "a scam" or "woke" investing? Is it because it introduces a class system in the public equity space that they consider themselves to be lesser in?</td>

I found out it was because it was in the process of getting acquired for a set price, and thus it plateaued at that price.\n\nNaturally I went looking in my account to see how it did, and I can't find it.  As I understand it, an acquired company stock turns into the stock of the acquiring company. That symbol is TBA, and I don't see it anywhere.\n\nAnyone have any insight what happened to it?\n\n\nAlso, I can't exactly ask my bank, since I have 3, and I forgot exactly which one it was.

This is a fairly large dataset (about 2 gb) that is updated daily.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nIve trained Neural Networks (Machine Learning) to recognize topics, emotions, sentiment etc in snippets of texts (headlines, tweets etc etc). Each snippet of text in the database gets assigned a score by being processed through these models. From here these scores are converted in to time series in order to see how emotions, narratives or sentiment evolves over time\n\n**What are you seeing in the plot?**\n\nThe plot is an excerpt from a dashboard ive build. It shows (stock market specific) sentiment towards China in financial headlines/tweets etc over time. The legend shows other metrics which are switched off for clarity reasons.

TheStreet score**\n\nThe first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I’m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.\n\nFrom thestreet.com:\n\n***A (Excellent)*** *– The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication — not a guarantee — we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*\n\nAnd about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):\n\n*TheStreet Ratings’ stock model projects a stock’s total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*\n\n**2. Zacks Rank**\n\nIt is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we’re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company’s shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:\n\n*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;amp;P 500’s +10.6% .*\n\n**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**\n\nWe’re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.\n\nWjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:\n\n*“A” Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a “****Strong Buy****“.*\n\n*“B” rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a “****Buy****“.*\n\n**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**\n\nIt is required that the Yahoo Finance stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.\n\n**5. Piotroski F-Score**\n\nThe Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company’s financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:\n\n*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*\n\nIt is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from https://www.gurufocus.com.\n\n**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**\n\nThe rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.\n\n*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*\n\n*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*\n\nPlease note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the reading. What do you think about this stock selection and the strategy?

It appears instead that I simply am unable to trade the    shares I own, at least that's how it appears in my Fidelity account.   From the announcement today:\n\n&amp;gt;Following  the closing of its acquisition on August 31, 2021  by affiliates of  Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, Blackstone Real  Estate Income  Trust, Inc. and Blackstone Property Partners, QTS Realty  Trust ("QTS")  announced that holders of its 6.50% Series A Cumulative  Convertible  Perpetual Preferred Limited Liability Company Units (the  "New Series A  Preferred Units") will have the right, until the close of  business on  October 14, 2021, to convert each New Series A Preferred Unit into  $172.84 in cash. Thereafter, holders of New Series A Preferred Units  will have the right to convert each unit into $167.40  in cash. At the  closing of the acquisition, each outstanding share of  QTS 6.50% Series B  Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock was  automatically  converted into one New Series A Preferred Unit.  \nAdditional   information regarding the conversion is included in a notice of   occurrence of a fundamental change that has been distributed to holders   of New Series A Preferred Units. Holders who wish to convert their New   Series A Preferred Units should contact their broker, bank or other   nominee. Computershare is serving as the conversion agent and can be   contacted at c/o Computershare, Voluntary Corporate Actions, 150 Royall   Street Suite V, Canton, MA 02021 or \[redacted email\]\n\nIt  appears I should be able to convert the shares to cash but Fidelity  seems not to be able to handle that, at least not via the app. Does  anyone know the way to go about this?</td>

      <td>I've been watching a few crypto markets over the past three months. Was about to buy, but before I could the prices started shooting up crazy high. Personally, I think I'm seeing a dead cat bounce and the prices will come back to sane levels within a month. The price movement in a ton of these assets has gone vertical, and volume is starting to decrease. I think it's just hype and people diversifying their Bitcoin and Ethereum profits for other assets.\n\nI'm not looking for advice on my personal situation as there are other factors that will influence my buying habits in the next month to two. I just want to make sure my general sense of investing when prices go vertical is more or less sound. Basically, if I already hold the asset I should sell some of my position once the chart starts rounding, and if I don't drop a limit order around where I think the price will crash down to within a couple months.

      <td>Who else is concerned about cybersecurity stocks when the taper starts?\n\nI love love love cybersecurity stocks, think they are in an underdeveloped sector that has plenty of challenges that will be addressed by many of the stocks like CRWD, FTNT, PANW, etc in the future\n\nHOWEVER\n\nI am most concerned out of any sector of stocks in the cybersecurity space when tapering begins or starts to become a real issue (in maybe 4-6 months?). To me, these stocks which are both tech and growth in a space that is still so under defined is going to suffer the most from taper more than tech names that have proven reliable for years and years, and bc the sector has easily done the best out of any "growth" stock in the past year or so. The problem is they are both speculative and successful stocks this year which means the most likely culprit for profit taking in comparison to FAANG stocks which the average trader still tries to hold onto for their entire life. \n\nWhat do people make of this? As much as I'd love to go totally all in on them ASAP, with tapering at some point going to rear it's ugly head probably in a few months, I'm not quite sure.</td>

      <td>I think discussions around uranium investments are sorely missing from this forum. There are a lot of people on the r/UraniumSqueeze subreddit who knows this field much better than I do but this is my attempt at a short dd.\n\nYou probably have heard of the "uraniumsqueeze" hypothesis, maybe you laughed about it and thought, "yeah right, uranium is just for the boomers that don't understand my precious safemoon/BTC/GME/TSLA/AMZN/APPL investments".\n\n The bull thesis on uranium equities is simple: **extreme supply and demand dislocations**. Uranium production has not kept up with consumption for years. How is this possible and why did it happen? \n\nCurrent low price. After the last uranium bubble in 2007, when uranium reached $140/lb prices, uranium prices have been depressed and hovering around $27-30/lb. There are several reasons for this: 1, Fukushima and the associated reduced popularity of nuclear power; 2, oversupply of cheap uranium from nuclear weapons stockpiles during years of disarmament, this is not happening anymore and the stockpiles from this period are running low. **The current price of uranium is lower than the cost of producing in most mines.** The mines that can produce at or below the current price can not supply nearly enough to satisfy the demand of the nuclear power plants.\n\nSupply issues. 1, The low uranium prices has caused most uranium producers to reduce or entirely stop production, this includes the two largest producers in the world, Kazatomprom has reduced their production by 20% until 2023 ([https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Kazatomprom-extends-uranium-production-cuts-into-2](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Kazatomprom-extends-uranium-production-cuts-into-2)), Cameco has kept their McArthur mine closed since 2018 (this is the largest high-grade uranium deposit in the world). Starting up a mine that has been closed for years can take a long time (many months, maybe more than a year). **Most of the uranium mining companies that you will find on the stock market are not producing at all due to the current low price or uranium!** They know that uranium price have to rise and they can't afford to produce at the current price. Many companies will not even consider production until uranium reaches \~$65/lb; 2, covid caused further reductions in uranium production; 3, Due to the decade long uranium slump since Fukushima there are very few companies in the sector, 30-40 companies are involved in uranium mining, a resource responsible for 10% of the worlds electricity generation!\n\nDemand. 1, 10% of global electricity comes from ~440 nuclear powerplants, these powerplants need a reliable supply of uranium. Uranium is a minimal part of the cost of running a nuclear reactor, to the plant operators it does not matter that much if the uranium costs $30/lb or $100/lb; 2, Despite all the naysayers who think nuclear is dying, the demand for uranium is expected to increase for the foreseeable future. ~50 new nuclear plants are planned or under construction. Old reactors that were supposed to retire are having their lives extended. Many countries will not be able to reach their CO2 reduction goals without nuclear power; 3, due to the low price of uranium a lot of the former uranium producers are now buying uranium on the spot market and stockpiling it, they know that the current prices are a bargain and that they have to go up. 4, the US is establishing a uranium strategic reserve and plan to start buying up a total of $1.5-billion of uranium. 5, **Maybe the most important factor is the Sprott Uranium Trust that entered the market two weeks ago**. The Sprott trust was created to capitalize on the current situation, they plan to buy and hold uranium until the prices are significantly higher. Since they entered the market 2 weeks ago the uranium spot price has steadily risen by &amp;gt;10% and just reached its five-year high today ($34.63). Mind you, this is still very low.\n\nWhy should you care? The combination of supply and demand issues will cause the uranium price to rise. It just reached a 5-year high and I would be surprised if it does not reach $40/lb by the end of the year, it is reasonable to expect it to reach $65/lb in the next two years. \n\nSo, a doubling of the uranium price in a couple of years, what's the big deal you might say? Maybe you think your favorite investment is likely to more than double in two years?\n\nWell, turns out that most of the uranium companies (producers/developers/explorers) are heavily leveraged to the uranium price. If the uranium price doubles, most of the companies in the uranium sector are likely to much more than double, by how much depends on the company. In addition, many of the uranium bulls think that uranium prices might go much higher than $65/lb and maybe reach even higher than they did in 2007. In any case, there is money to be made in the next few years in uranium.\n\nRisks: 1, another Chernobyl or Fukushima would of course be bad news for the entire sector. However, the existing power plants still need uranium and the current uranium price is still too low, so it is possible that some gains will be maintained even with a bad accident; 2, Increased number of plants retiring. Some countries, e.g. Germany, are retiring all their nuclear power plants. If more countries follow suit it will over time reduce demand; 3, In theory it might be possible for producers to pick up the slack faster than expected and reduce the supply shortage and put a damper on the rise in the uranium price. So far, this does not seem to be the case, but even the low cost producers are limiting their production, and new or mothballed mines take time and resources to get up and running.\nSo, while there are risks, I think there is more than a good chance that we will see at least a doubling of the uranium price. \n\nThis is obviously not investment advice, I don't know anything about all of this and you should definitely do your own research. Personally I'm invested in a bunch of different uranium companies: DNN, GLATF, CCJ, PALATF, CVVUF, STTDF. And I plan to continue buying if there are any dips and maybe start buying into the Sprott Uranium Trust as well (SRUUF). Oh yeah, the plan is for SRUUF to get listed on the NYSE this fall, that should hopefully bring in a lot more money into buying physical uranium and continue to drive up the price.</td>

      <td>I've been watching the gene-editing space since the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) gained popularity and studying companies more closely following the Nobel Prize in Chemistry being awarded in 2020 for the discovery of CRISPR.\n\nI began tracking Caribou Biosciences (NASDAQ: CRBU) after its IPO in July when I heard that it tackles cancer and is in fact the first CRISPR company (it was founded in 2011 by Jennifer Doudna and Rachel Haurwitz, who hold several CRISPR-related patents).\n\nThe resources below led me to conclude that the stock CRBU is relatively undervalued and has great potential given CRISPR applications beyond human therapeutics such as agriculture, livestock, and basic research.\n\n\- CRISPR co-discoverer Jennifer Doudna's [Nobel lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSrSIErIxMQ).\n\n\- [In a Nutshell video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAhjPd4uNFY) about how "genetic engineering will change everything forever".\n\n\- Caribou Biosciences' ["About" page](https://www.cariboubio.com/about/), which includes partnerships and intellectual property licenses.\n\n\- Caribou Biosciences [President and CEO Rachel Haurwitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9lcWxlHKGM) explains next-generation CRISPR hybrid RNA-DNA (chRDNA; pronounced "Chardonnay"), noting that high-efficiency gene insertion "really remains the holy grail in the genome-editing field" (around the 5-minute mark).\n\n\- [GEN article](https://www.genengnews.com/news/vintage-chardonnay-caribou-biosciences-files-for-100m-ipo/) about what the company will do with the cash raised from its IPO.\n\n\- [Fierce Biotech article](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/after-ditching-editas-abbvie-taps-caribou-for-new-crispr-car-t-pact) about AbbVie tapping Caribou Biosciences after ditching Editas Medicine.\n\n\- [Bloomberg segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikiu2VFhTjU) with Rachel Haurwitz mentioning how CRISPR is "now in probably nearly every biology lab around the globe" (around the 11-minute mark).\n\n\- [ARKG holdings](https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_GENOMIC_REVOLUTION_MULTISECTOR_ETF_ARKG_HOLDINGS.pdf) as of the end of August; see the [main page](https://ark-funds.com/arkg) for updates.\n\nI've gained a lot from reading tweets by a small community of CRISPR investors on Twitter, though I found that resources on CRBU specifically are scattered all around, so I decided to collect some here for anyone interested in investing in Caribou Biosciences.\n\nAnalyst coverage will be initiated in earnest at the beginning of September when the post-IPO quiet period ends. I expect you will hear more about the stock then.</td>

      <td>Say you're holding a short put against a stock and that stock pays a dividend. Upon paying a dividend, the price of that stock would decrease by the amount of the divided paid but would the price of the short put you're holding increase in value (therefore losing you money as you are short the put)?\n\nOr are planned future dividends already taken into account when a put is originally priced (i.e. if a put has 150 days to expiration and the underlying stock is scheduled to pay 2 dividends during that time, will the price of the put would be higher in price than it would otherwise be if the underlying stock did not pay a dividend (higher in price because after taking into account future dividends, the actual stock price is actually "lower" that what it appears?</td>

      <td>From many beginners books recommended on this site (Bogleheads, Random walk down Wall Street, The Four Pillars of Investing), the argument for long-term index investing lies on the assumption that the market is efficient and the stock price characteristic is that of a random walk. What would happen then, if that wasn't the case anymore, as in many frontier markets? Does long-term investment in stock still makes sense? Is index ETF still a good choice when the extra TER in active funds eats up the larger return? Or it's better to find less volatile forms of investment? How can it be that the large cap index is weakly efficient and shows signs of random walk, while the rest of the market isn't?\n\nFor context, in Vietnam - a frontier market, saving interest has for the first time dip below the average index return of the last decade and current corporate bond rate. The stock market trading volume has doubled in less than 2 years, with a huge influx of new, inexperienced investors and is on the second largest rally in the mere 20 years of its existence.</td>
