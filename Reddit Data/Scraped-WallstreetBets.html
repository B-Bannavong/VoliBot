      <td>Ever since GMREEEE this sub has been filled with people from r/all calling for the end of payment for order flow for a variety of reasons.  Now the front page has a news article talking about how the SEC chair is thinking about ending payment for order flow.  I just wanted to say that if you're against payment for order flow there's probably a 95 percent chance that you don't know what a call condor spread is.  PFOF gives you no or reduced commissions and also makes the options market more liquid.  Here are some arguments against PFOF that I've seen on this sub:\n\n1. HedGe FuNd GiVe BAd FiL.\n\n       In reality you can set the price for what you want your options to be filled at.  This can be done by making a FUCKING LIMIT ORDER.  There is probably not a single professional option trader that buys or sells options with a market order.  Options are, by their nature, illiquid on a majority of underlyings given that you have thousands of combinations of strikes and dates to choose from.  Again, especially if you trade spreads, you should be placing limit orders for your positions.  Also, if you remove PFOF this liquidity issue will only get worse.  This is just the reality of gutting several billion dollar firms that write and buy options.  Less money in the options market means less liquidity.\n\n2. HooDgE FunD ManiPuLaeT MarkET wItH my OrDeR InForMatIoN\n\n       I can right now go on my think or swim platform and scan for options orders under 10k (or however large you want) and look at the bid/ask spread to tell if this trader bought or sold these options.  If I really wanted to I could go into the API and make a robot that does this for me and organizes all this information into some sort of bullshit spreadsheet.  Small orders like these (the kind retail makes) provide a reasonable guess as to where retail is positioned.  I'm just some jack off wsb troll with a think or swim account and I have already laid how how to detect retail positions.  If I can do it then the big dogs certainly can do the same even without payment for order flow.  \n\n   One more thing: If you lose money on your 10 delta put it's because it was a bad trade, not because some Algo picked out your 5 lot position and spent millions of dollars manipulating the market to shake you out of your 200 dollar position.</td>

      <td>**Edit: Cut the champagne and open the steak boys!**\n\nChewy is an e-commerce retailer of pet food and supplies, mainly active in the USA. Last quarter they posted USD 2.14bn in revenue from 19.8 million customers (600k of which were new additions). For Q2 they project 2.15-2.17 billion in revenue for a very modest 1% q-o-q growth.\n\nI think they'll outdo their (very conservative) revenue guidance, but fall short on customer additions for the quarter and revenue guidance for the following quarters. Chewy is currently trading at the upper end of its historical P/S ratio, (save for a brief time in Jan/Feb 2021 when it was even higher than today). It’s P/S of 4.76 is relatively high for its industry (as it is a low margin retailer, not a platform business). It’s actually higher than Amazon, which I would argue is too high to make sense and I expect a short-term downside re-evaluation of Chewy after earnings.\n\n**Reasons**\n\n* **Competition catching up**\n\nThe key investment thesis for Chewy has been "Fast-growing pet e-commerce industry" and "growing faster than its competition in its fast-growing industry". I believe the second reason may be moderating. While Chewy is the clear market leader, I'm seeing several signs that its competitors (in both e-commerce and retail) are slowly catching up. Walmart (biggest brick and mortal pet retailer) just reported a big revenue beat. Petsmart (brick and mortar focused) is looking to increase revenue this year following a bad 2020. Petco reported great earnings two weeks ago.\n\nThese good results could be because the overall market ("pet ecommerce") is expanding. I don't think so. The market expansion took place in 2020, the number of adopted pets is on a clear downtrend. If most other big players are doing quite well, I suspect they are doing so at the expense of Chewy.\n\n* **Low net customers additions**\n\nIn Q1 2021 Chewy added a net 600k customers, their lowest absolute increase in two years. I expect them to report even lower additions this quarter as they follow up Q2 of 2020, their biggest quarter of customer additions ever. 1 year is a very typical "cliff" during which many former customers start to churn (according to Chewy CEO Sumit Singh). Since they haven't increased their marketing spend significantly this Q, I expect high churn and low gross additions, which is a bad early sign for growth companies.\n\n[Customer additions per quarter](https://preview.redd.it/dkmcffawmxk71.png?width=799&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5521fbd76802f34cacbc31617550af9f34177b9e)\n\n* **Moderating growth rates in a fast-growth industry**\n\nChewy's app store rankings in Q2 have been at its lowest level since February 2019. Who downloads apps from the store? New customers, usually. Remember the part where I think they will have unexpectedly low gross customer additions this quarter?\n\n[Petco App gaining ground on Chewy](https://preview.redd.it/z5yvwgzjnxk71.png?width=1616&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=38c746658cf948bc19a514b436ada7ed21cc071a)\n\nPetco is clearly aggressively promoting their app which is currently nearly as popular as Chewy's. You can see how their spikes coincide with drops in Chewy's ranking, leading me to believe that Chewy is losing more business than usual to its competition.\n\n* **Profitability**\n\nWhile profitability is less relevant for Chewy, on Q1 earnings they were relatively sanguine about their expected costs for 2021. Since then I expect hiring, material and logistics costs to have gone up quite a bit, which might result in them offering a more pessimistic profitability guidance.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summary: Chewy has achieved a high PS ratio thanks to its promise of outgrowing its competitors in a market that is already fast-growing in itself. I believe their competitive advantage is eroding ever so slightly and will result in earnings that Wall Street doesn't like.\n\n**Short interest**\n\nChewy currently has what I would consider a relatively large short interest considering its relatively strong fundamentals. As of August, 16.4% of the short was floated. Make of that what you will.\n\n**Risks**\n\n* A lot of Chewy customers actually use autoship, which may distort the data I'm looking at and allow them to surprise to the upside on revenue\n* I do all my shopping for my pets on Chewy\n\n**Positions**\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpekcjdcpxk71.png?width=331&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f6c05b0d43d825435b4e3ef664c4ca05d062dd67</td>

      <td>This started about 4 years ago when my son was 2 years old. I started to supplement his picture books and cartoons with beginner options books and Martin Shkerli's live videos on how to pick pharmaceutical stocks. Over the course of these years I feel like he has retained absolutely nothing even though I have spent every waking minute trying to make him understand. I have done almost everything that I have thought of including having Jerome Powell's speeches play while he is sleeping and  only having Warren Buffet on the TV to try and make him understand the market.  I felt as though I got to a breaking point when he couldn't differentiate between a straddle and a strangle even though we we went through different strategies for almost a month straight. I finally convinced my wife that we were doing the right thing when I said that he will soon be a Wendy's worker begging his wife's husband for a weekly allowance because he will never amount to be anything.  I couldn't fathom  raising a kid who was not able to able to make a profit from trading options by the time he was 10.

      <td>TLDR:Meta materials stock goes brrrr. Should break out tomorrow.\n\nYesterday i posted my analysis of the 1 day chart explaining why i think are on the brink of a breakout. Link below. This is a follow up from that.\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pflz6a/meta_materials_go_brrrr_a_technical_analysis/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3)\n\nToday i will be showing you my analysis of the 15 minute chart from the day as well as some short interest update.\n\nStart off with saying that ortex signaled today as the beginning of a short squeeze, as i predicted we would meet today with a considerable amount of short volume which ortex suggest the short interest increased by 20% today.\n\nThis is basically exactly what i presumed would happen based on yesterdays chart.\n\nCheck the chart out below and my explanation of the analysis\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/04f9jqfm7zk71.jpg?width=2208&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=57ee934669fc6fa9519013426eb47dd8745cf27b\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q41cuejn7zk71.png?width=686&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=913483f292a8e2ce8732dd50c3cdf2c2d4aee042\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h9zcxofo7zk71.jpg?width=1534&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=43aaa0d8c7bffc9d326628741cac23c893af0328\n\n \n\nAgain we are looking the 15 minute chart plus the same 2 indicators as before.\n\nRSI with divergence line in middle, and on balance volume on bottom.\n\nWe have a pennant forming here. This is typically a continuation pattern, however sometimes it can fail and reject down, like in instances of heavy shorting.\n\nTo determine the most likely outcome we look at our indicators and see which way momentum is taking us.\n\nWhile price has consolidated tighter and tighter today, RSI and OBV has continuously put it in higher lows. so despite the price action moving sideways we are gathering strength with each and every candle. At this point its really just up to us. All it takes is buying volume to increase and we take our next leg up. My guess is in the mid to high $7 range\n\nMETA is primed my boys. LFG!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</td>

      <td>Hi ladies and gents.  I have returned from a little time-out from WSB (mods I am reformed, promise) to bring you an insight deep into why TTCF is going to be successful.\n\nOthers have already covered all the technical details, kudos to them [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/peofan/ttcf\_the\_clock\_wont\_stop/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/peofan/ttcf_the_clock_wont_stop/)\n\nand\n\n[https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pea3en/tattoo\_chef\_complete\_dd\_ttcf/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pea3en/tattoo_chef_complete_dd_ttcf/)\n\nI'm here to dive into the murky art of "market research."  Uncovering value by figuring out, do people actually like this shit and will it continue to grow?  Who are vegans?  Why is anyone buying this?\n\n1. Anecdotal research: I asked my Vegan girlfriend to buy some and try it.  We live in the Vegan capital of the world, her facebook group has 9,000 vegans in it.  When we asked what people thought about the food, people said: it tastes really good (approx. 20 responses, all enthusiastic) and 1 response of "it has wayy too many grams of fat."  The other vegans gave this person crap for being too picky.\n2. What is the thesis for plant based food in America?  According to sentient media, 3% of US population or 10M people are vegan.  But it gets even more interesting when we dive into what percent of the population is now prefering not to eat meat...that has increased by about 10%!  Combine a population of tens of millions that HAVE to eat food, with the problem of having very few options geared towards them (minus, just eat carbs and vegetables, which vegetarians and vegans HATE) you can see a market ready for monopolies.  Beyond meat is doing great.\n\nOpinion piece; Why has this occured?  I think GenZ and millenials have better access to information as they are more internet savvy and likely to seek information.  There is a ton of information now about practices in the meat industry (has anyone seen Cowspiracy on netflix?  LOL). People are shifting ideas about how they consume, and that is ok.  I keep eating meat but I aknowledge alot of science points to the sodium and fat in my red meat will kill me earlier lol.  Also animals are being killed for me to eat.  I'm ok with that too.  Ask your friends though; if they had to kill an animal to eat it, would they?  Do people even think about what they are eating when they eat meat?\n\nSo i'm taking what I know about millenials &amp;amp; genZ, my GF, and some other vegans/vegetarians I know to decide theres very few plant based options and Tatood Chef seems to be doing really well and gaining mind-share.  They are in major retailers and now landed a deal with Kroger.  I see a shift in the softness and open mindedness of future generations to reject meat more often, in favor of plant based offerings.\n\nBased on this intuition, I did what any rational person would do and yolo'd 1/3rd of my account into OTM options expiring in Oct. , based on other's DD and because I believe this product has a future.  Maybe others will too.\n\nTLDR: the market, boomers especially, are shorting the shit out of this stock because they don’t think there’s much room for Plant based foods.  Our edge is this market looks primed to pop from grassroots support from self-educated youth generations.\n\nPosition: 50 x Oct15 25 call\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yj25708tqyk71.png?width=700&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=77eb070b4a3fd1fcc01cff8b90885e71f8c45763</td>

It's not hard to figure out MMs and Institutions are shorting the stock and are manipulating the stock price to keep it below $8 to have all those call options expire worthless.    \n\n\n**Upcoming catalysts:**   \n\- Ex-dividend date is September 9th for their $0.40/annual dividend ($0.10 for this quarter).   \n\- Dividend Payout is October 6th.  \n\- UWMC accepting cryptocurrency by the end of September    \n\- $300 Million in share buybacks   \n\n\nNow if you add in the number of shares being shorted (approximately 10 million shares) with them having to return those shares by the ex-dividend date (September 9th), along with the open interests in both the $8 and $9 calls (50k x 100 = 5 million shares).

      <td>Hello retards,\n\nI've been watching $GME like a hawk all week and the correlation between volume and price for the past week is incredible and to me seems very, very bullish. Check it out:\n\nAugust 26th at open: Spikes on high volume (889k shares in first hour, goes up $10). It waffles for a bit  as volume declines and hits its daily peak at $217 on 851k shares. Volume drops like a rock for the rest of the day and it sinks back down to $203.80 at close.\n\nAugust 27th: Jumps from $207 to $213 at open, volume goes down then back up over the course of the day and the price kinda waffles. This one doesn't follow the trend so well. The next day does, however\n\nAugust 30th: Jumps from $206 to $215 in the first hour on high volume (547k shares). Volume declines for the rest of the day and it drops again\n\nAugust 31st: Jumps about $6 in the first 2 hours on high volume (315k first hour, 729k second).\n\nSept 1st (Today): Jumps to hit its weekly peak of $231 at open on its **highest one-hour volume all week**, with 1.09M shares traded in the first hour. It then spends the rest of the day tanking on decreasing volume.\n\nIs it just me or does this seem incredibly bullish? It seems if we had a sustained high volume event we could see this stock rocket. Fortunately we probably do, as Sept 6-8th are the 3 days before earnings. Once this thing hits WSB and news outlets consistently we could easily be riding the rocket. Also because you're all brain damaged, this isn't financial advice.\n\n[crayon lines &amp;amp; arrows for our special readers](https://preview.redd.it/9y9o5d5sgzk71.png?width=1913&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7912e178518b335e0a07490fce23d79aaf7a63cf)\n\nAs a side note: comparing this to $AMC is pretty funny. It literally tanks on some of its recent volume spikes. Biggest P&amp;amp;D of this week and stands no chance to keep going up.\n\nPositions: 3x $GME 10/15 690c @ 2.90(?) cost basis, probably buying one last one tomorrow.</td>

      <td>ARK Investment Management is looking to debut a new ETF that will focus on transparency in companies and shun vice and sectors that run afoul of Environmental, Social and Governance  investing like fossil fuels.\n\nIn an SEC filing, Cathie Wood's shop outlines the fund, which looks to be at least 80% invested in stocks in its benchmark Transparency Index, published by Solactive.\n\n"Companies operating in the following industries, as determined by the Index provider, are excluded from the Index: (i) alcohol, (ii) banking, (iii) chemicals, (iv) confectionary, (v) fossil fuel transportation, (vi) gambling, (vii) metals, (viii) mineral, (ix) natural gas, (x) oil, and (xi) tobacco," ARK says in its filing.\n\nIf approved, the ETF would be the second that Ark has launched this year. In March, the company started a fund focused on space-related investments, which has risen about 4% since its debut and now has more than $600 million in assets. Meanwhile, the firm’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up to $22.5 billion, although it’s down 2% year-to-date -- compared with a gain of more than 20% for the S&amp;amp;P 500.</td>

      <td>Uranium.\n\nSure, there are no flashing LEDs like CRSR adds to all of their products, but that’s because we don’t need it. Uranium already glows in the dark! (see footnote).\n\nMaybe Uranium isn't as sexy as some over-hyped under-developed treadmill with an iPad glued to it that kills babies, and it is lacking in buzzwords like "cloud data analytics," but uranium is energy. And everything we do takes energy, and this is the cleanest, densest, most likely candidate for the immediate future. There are already big incumbents in energy that need to get shouldered aside, so this will be a slower play than the up 50% in a week flavors of the month (which then falls 90%), but this is the real deal. With calls you can still get that 50%, or 500%, but shares will take some time. That said, NXE is up 18.8% in 5 trading sessions, and URA 12.08%. Just barely OTM calls versus last week are up 360% and 500% for NXE ($5 and $4 front month). That's not exactly [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/).\n\nUranium has a serious bull case of ahead of it. A new fund is in town (Sprott) who is buying up all the physical uranium. Get ready to gap up. Yes you have heard some of this before, and I peddled Uranium a full on year ago, but this fund is a market mover and it changes everything.\n\nSorry if you saw this quickly deleted multiple times. F'ing automod.\n\nTLDR, 1) since 2019 supply has been below demand for uranium as the market continues to deal with a supply overhang and over-investment by miners from the previous market cycle. COVID then reduced supply by a further 30% through mine closures that have continued for 2021 and the supply overhang is finally gone. 2) More nuclear reactors are being built worldwide than decommissioned, developing nations have hopped on board the nuclear train, and 3) if any country is serious about getting to carbon neutral then the only realistic avenue is via massive expansion of the nuclear fleet. Lastly, 4) there is a new physical trust (Sprott) busy buying up all of the uranium and driving up the spot price. It’s working.\n\nUranium spot is $34.60 right now, 2007 was $137. That’s a lot of upside baby. Oh, and did I mention that the Uranium market is small? Tiny. Super tiny. WSB could blow this thing up. There isn’t an entire industry of traders, hedgers, and dilettantes (that’s a nice way of saying degenerates) trading U like there are for oil or other commodities.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: it begins! Massive gap up today (Uranium spot updates daily, not constantly like oil) from $34.60-&amp;gt;$35.65.\n\n**1. The Setup**: Uranium is already on a 5 year trend line of tendies\n\nUranium has been in a bear market since 2007. It started to finally sell through the over supply and over investment of the last market cycle and has been climbing from its low of $18.50 since 2016. This was already a 4 year trend line, and then COVID came along.\n\nCOVID changed the uranium market in two main ways. First, it dramatically reduced global supply by about 30% in 2020 and 2021 due to mine closures by many of the majors and juniors. These closures have allowed the sticky overhang from the last decade to finally get put on the spot market. Second, there appears to be an OPEC+ of uranium forming. Miners, no doubt still traumatized from last time they aggressively expanded productions, are not opening new mines even as spot prices surge. Instead, they continue to provide quarterly guidance that they are operating below capacity for the rest of the year, and are selling old supply. They aren’t formally a cartel like OPEC is, but there seems to be some game theory going on here. It is in the miners' best interest to try to exactly match the demand of U on a global scale and then be able to dictate the price. Since fuel costs are just 2% of the operating costs of a nuclear reactor, utilities can also stomach significant increases in spot prices without effecting their generation rates of \~ $.02/KwH (as cheap as coal, far below all renewables in pricing).\n\nU is $34.60 right now which is 75.24% below its peak in 2007. In a market with all-time highs all over the place, U has a long way to run. What will miner profits be if U hits $100+ again? Massive.\n\n**2. New Demand**: Global demand has outpaced supply\n\nPlanned Reactor Starts in Gross MWe of new capacity (from world-nuclear.org)\n\n* 2021: 5,711\n* 2022: 13,559\n* 2023: 13,276\n* 2024: 7,569\n* 2025: 5,112\n* 2026: 6,997\n* 2027: 4,100\n\nCredit Suisse offers their own global view of supply &amp;amp; demand here. Get your sunglasses on as this assumes the US fleet is shrinking into 2030. That likely won’t be the case. See comments #1 below, automod doesn't like my links.\n\nFirst, if you are from the US then you are likely biased against nuclear. Get over it. The US has a very old fleet and has been periodically retiring plants rather than performing maintenance. I’ll get back to the US later, but the global view is very, very positive. Globally, many developing nations are starting a nuclear fleet. It’s cheap and it doesn’t pollute. India, Slovakia, Belarus, and Pakistan all have new plants started or starting in the next year. France continues to expand and sell energy, while China seems serious about cutting CO2 emissions and is massively expanding their existing fleet, as well as breaking ground on the world’s first SMR earlier this year.\n\nSo back to the USA—the US mostly acts as a drag. A reactor in New York just closed, and others throughout the country are always wavering on the edge of retirement. This is set to change, but it depends upon politics, so we’ll see (and the right likes nuclear too, it’s not just about the left's CO2). The Secretary of Energy is committed to keeping every single US plant operating as it prepares to transition to a fleet of fast breeding, small modular reactors (SMR’s) in the “late 2020s, early 2030s.” (this just means highly fuel efficient with far, far less waste, and reactors the size of a 3-4 story apartment building instead of a city block. Each will power 500,000+ homes, so they can be “close” to cities they power and also reduce infrastructure costs.) She is working with legislatures to allow all currently operating plants to essentially receive carbon credits as an incentive for utilities to keep the plants running and well maintained until the SMR roll-out.\n\nYes, this is a long horizon for the US, but the US is only one part of the uranium market and a very minor part of this bull case. Globally, supply/demand are already tight, and the world fleet is slated to expand. Utilities can see the writing on the wall and will want to start placing orders now for future delivery (spot market for Uranium is quite different from other commodities—purchasing, delivery, enrichment, and feeding take years). You can bet these utilities are looking at supply/demand graphs and already panicking. Spot is going to start gapping up instead of ticking.\n\n**3. Green Energy**: The Elephant in the Room\n\nNuclear power is the greenest scalable energy on the planet. Hydro destroys entire riparian ecosystems, wind and solar are both CO2 heavy in terms of manufacturing and are slow ROI on the carbon expenditure as well as having short functional commercial lifespans, while geothermal is quite literally tied to very specific locations (OK, I don’t know anything about tidal, but other than reading about some plans being nixed by NIBY Boomers I’m not seeing it either).\n\nThese renewable forms of power generation have another cost: land. Aside from geothermal, these are not power dense generators. You can't put 12,000 acres of wind turbines next to NYC. Here is an article working through the cost in land to electrify just British Colombia’s transport grid. The takeaway is that nuclear wins by a landslide: 2.4 m2/kWh versus solar’s 36.9m2, hydro’s 54 m2, and wind’s 72.1 m2. If you want to electrify the US transport grid then you can either build some nuclear plants, or convert all of Nevada to a giant solar farm. I mean, what is Nevada good for anyway?\n\nNumbers on energy density coming from here: damn you automods, see comments for link #2.\n\nThe latest generation of nuclear plants, SMRs, are small and safe. They can be built alongside cities to save CO2 and money that would otherwise go into infrastructure. How many more fires are we going to see every fire season as PG&amp;amp;E and other utilities run millions of miles of hot lines all over the country? This too is a cost of the current way of locating and distributing energy. This all changes with SMRs, and all for the better.\n\nBiden has made some surprisingly strong claims about aiming the US at net zero, and we’re hardly a climate activist country. If this happens in other countries, and perhaps the US, then it means we are looking at hundreds upon hundreds of new nuclear power plants in the next two decades, not just the few dozen currently in the planning stages over the coming 2020s. This will be the renaissance of nuclear, and it is coming.\n\nThink about it. If there is any chance in hell of reducing carbon emissions, then nuclear is the path forward. Everything else is a half measure.\n\n**4. Sprott Physical Uranium Trust**: The T-Rex in the Room\n\nThis is a new fund from an old hand in physical trusts. Sprott’s Physical Uranium Trust (U.U – Canadian listed, NYSE coming in \~4m) purchases uranium on the spot market and then warehouses it. That’s it, that’s the whole plan. This is meteoric.\n\nAs shares of U.U are issued Sprott takes that money and buys uranium, which increases their NAV. So long as they have a premium to NAV they keep buying. They’ve only been buying physical uranium for two weeks now, but **they’ve already purchased 13.3% of the estimated global uranium production for all of 2021**. Read that sentence again. 20.59m lbs of the projected world supply of 154m lbs. Jesus Christ are these guys a market force to be reckoned with. How is this not illegal? They've only been buying for TWO FUCKING WEEKS.\n\nLook at spot price versus their holdings. They march up and up in tandem. Spot has gone up 7.1% in the last month, with all of those gains coming within days of when Sprott started buying.\n\nSee comment link for google spreadsheet of Sprott and spot rate. #3 in my comment.\n\n**5. There are short sellers here**\n\nSome entities sell naked uranium deliveries. In a market as slow moving and opaque as uranium is this probably seemed like a good idea at the time. How much of a factor would this be? I don't honestly know. Uranium is not like other commodities with all their nifty reporting and data. We'll find out?\n\n**Positions or Ban:** OK, we know you all just skipped to the end anyway\n\nGo long anything uranium.\n\nMiners/Exploration:\n\n* CCJ\n* NXE\n* Use google. Many are too small by marketcap for me to list here, but they are mostly small for a reason\n* U.U (This is Sprott. Buy this, but only if Canadian. Imagine what will happen when this gets NYSE listed in 2022!)\n* URA: ETF of major and minor miners, equipment production, all things uranium\n\n*Options*:\n\nAs we all know, there are only a few times when dealers work with your play instead of hedging against it, and one of those is when you buy far OTM calls. When you buy a far OTM call the dealer will also purchase or adjust their position matching your direction.\n\nSo, if you are buying calls (I would recommend calls *and* shares) then far OTM calls skew delta in our favor.\n\nThat out of the way, the Uranium market is slow, but Sprotts has started to speed things up.\n\nURA 10/22 $25c is about as high as I would go without going longer dated.\n\nAfter that, June 2022 $30+ is cheapish. No doubt you will all ignore this and buy something idiotic like front month $30. Really, don’t do that.\n\nNXE 2/22 or 12/22 $5 or $7. I did a few call debit spreads of buying 12/22 $5, selling $7. Probably should be greedier, but it seems so safe. What could go wrong?\n\n*Shares*: Buy NXE &amp;amp; URA.\n\nMy positions:\n\n* URA &amp;amp; NXE shares (some other too small of marketcap to list)\n* URA 10/22 $25c\n* URA 6/22 $28c &amp;amp; 30c\n* NXE 9/17 $5c\n* NXE 12/22 $5c\n* NXE 12/22 $7c\n\nfootnote: No, uranium does't glow in the dark you ape. You have to mix trace radioactive material with a fluor to do that.</td>

      <td>Twitter just officially announced [Super Follows](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651138/twitter-super-follow-launch-subscription-ios), a feature that allows users to set a monthly subscription price followers can pay to see exclusive tweets. This is pretty transparently an imitation of Onlyfans’ business model, except Twitter doesn’t have to worry about 1) building out user bases of creators and customers and 2) developing the infrastructure to legally host adult content (a big reason why Onlyfans briefly intended to pivot away from porn). \n\nOnlyfans’ valuation is likely [well over $1 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/onlyfans-promotes-its-sfw-app-as-it-seeks-funding-at-a-1b-valuation/) and is expected to grow to $2.2 billion in 2022 and $12.5 billion in 2023 [according to a leaked internal pitch deck](https://www.axios.com/onlyfans-investors-struggle-9cc92523-6607-40ad-9893-4175e7966b52.html). Given $400 million in operating revenue in 2020, those projections seem feasible. Regardless, Super Follows is perfectly positioned to sap a substantial portion of that revenue. That’s billions in future earnings that aren’t yet fully priced in to their current $52 billion market cap, which is based off of ~$4 billion in revenue for 2021. \n\n\nCurrently, Twitter won’t be earning the 20% fee Onlyfans charges, but this structure is likely to change following an introductory period (even moreso if Apple’s in-app purchases fee is lowered either through negotiation or court order). Twitter is covered up with camgirls, and it has wisely chosen to capitalize on this userbase without alienating its core audience. This isn’t a moonshot, but betting on a bump in their share price as this circulates through the news cycle should make for a quick payoff. 🚀🚀🚀</td>

      <td>\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor nor is this financial advice, make your own decisions. Data from PLTR's latest 10-K &amp;amp; 10-Q.\n\nPosition: long shares of stock @ $24.67 and have over doubled my position since Mar-21\n\nTL;DR – still bullish on PLTR and buying shares on down days. Financials improving each quarter. Waiting for the breakout.\n\nMy analysis primarily focuses on the financials of PLTR AFTER stripping out the Stock Based Compensation (SBC). For more background on this check my last post about it, but basically, I don’t believe the market should be putting so much weight on this when analyzing the financial health of the company: . Also, the fact that PLTR is allowed to present financial data in their 10-K &amp;amp; 10-Q filings after stripping out SBC shows that this is how the company should be analyzed. See previous post for more info on that: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lygxog/why\_pltr\_is\_still\_a\_growth\_tech\_stock\_you\_still/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lygxog/why_pltr_is_still_a_growth_tech_stock_you_still/)\n\nActuals = true GAAP results\n\nAdjusted = financials after stripping out SBC\n\nAnyways, here are the numbers and keep in mind that Q3-20 experienced abnormally high costs from when PLTR went public:\n\n[Actual amounts including SBC \(Stock Based Compensation\)](https://preview.redd.it/7zjpoy0l1yk71.png?width=684&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e8a474769499bbcbef7519ff0b93a55195ed07f8)\n\n[Actual QoQ change](https://preview.redd.it/luadb4om1yk71.png?width=855&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fe769d88a5bc4f76a8edc2e768c7a3b03c190d9b)\n\n[Actual QoQ change](https://preview.redd.it/2uw29zwn1yk71.png?width=624&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d766e7cc2f1cc42ddce5a7a2896fc77343171da9)\n\nRevenue, COGS, Gross profit are all improving minus Q3-20 when the company experienced a significant amount of non-recurring costs due to its IPO. Revenue growth is still strong QoQ at 10.1% and 49% since Q2-20.\n\nEBITDA is looking quite strong as this is now the 6th straight quarter of positive EBITDA. Additionally, EBITDA as a % of Revenue continues to grow which shows the company’ ability to grow profitability as they scale.\n\n[Actual Quarterly EBITDA](https://preview.redd.it/r055rw7r1yk71.png?width=678&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f2c73d447a51b4ab3fd1692cb92ad82fd6918d69)\n\n[Actual Quarterly EBITDA](https://preview.redd.it/d0r7fmgs1yk71.png?width=668&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d907b77027ca12dce83893bc2f4994fbc7b3c7ec)\n\nOn an adjusted basis, Revenue and Gross Profit continues to expand while SG&amp;amp;A costs have remained constant:\n\n[Adjusted amounts](https://preview.redd.it/c9m7w5wu1yk71.png?width=475&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0e46ca342cee63b1e8e84a103fe90f4dd4aef6b7)\n\n[Adjusted amounts](https://preview.redd.it/94d7uf0w1yk71.png?width=507&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4fdf6b9d4b45538d5b67fdfb5e53a746c1deb5d9)\n\nTo expand upon the adjusted costs of the company, PLTR is proving it is on the right track toward sustained profitability as their operating costs have remained constant while simultaneously expanding revenue and gross profit. This also means that the company is continuing to prove profitability as the costs as a % of revenue are trending lower and lower each period:\n\n[Adjusted amounts](https://preview.redd.it/37832yax1yk71.png?width=573&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=678a3b9870658a0f5633c27b6748f3a9ef542beb)\n\n[Adjusted amounts](https://preview.redd.it/vptptrdy1yk71.png?width=602&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=94646245b3948903ca7bba99953d06b70b74f5f8)\n\nLastly, EPS on an adjusted basis has been positive for the past 3 quarters:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d72trk702yk71.png?width=624&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=936fa8faa6836bc2b2905e49be9a530c943bc3d2\n\nQuick Balance Sheet Look:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vleuvfl12yk71.png?width=394&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0f576e99464be75a98d5d30820e3dbee8ee40cc2\n\nThis was the first Quarter that PLTR has reported $0 debt and have $2.3B in cash – quite impressive for a growth stock. Additionally, their current ratio and d/e ratios show no signs of liquidity/solvency issues (as expected).\n\nIn Summary: These posts don't generally focus on the qualitatives, but I have read almost nearly only great news about this company in the past 6 months yet the stock continues to get beaten down. The stock appears to be mainly being hurt due to 1) inflation fears, 2) differing opinions on valuation, and 3) stock based compensation criticism. However, none of these factors have an impact on the CORE operations of PLTR which I believe to be are extremely strong and all trending on the correct path. If long term investors can stay strong and continue to buy into this weakness, I think they will be happy they did so in 2-5 years’ time. I will be curious to see if PLTR can break out of the 27.50 resistance or if it will fail that level and retest the low 20s again.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/skenvzh22yk71.png?width=1544&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8053f895a7e8683e4e5878c2489787093c0dff58</td>

      <td>TLDR: Meta Materials inc go BRRR\n\nShort interest high, momentum going up.  High conviction entry.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4e5m8416etk71.jpg?width=1579&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cdc44d3de0a7f1b6c562020aa56528c1513ad711\n\nWe are looking at the 1 day chart below and 2 indicators. The yellow indicator is RSI with a divergence line rather than overbought and oversold lines. The blue indicator is on balance volume.\n\nDrawing a horizontal line on both indicators on where they closed today you can see the last time that daily RSI or obv has been this high was the last run up to $22 with the reverse merger dividend speculation.\n\nOBV has only been this high since the very tippy top of the peak. (this indicates that while price has been driven down the volume of the red days is being outweighed by the volume of the green days. This means that people have diamond hands. The idea of OBV is that price movements with low volume are much less significant than the same price movement on high volume.\n\nRSI: Last time RSI closed at this level on the uptrend (61.85) was on may 28th. May 28th had a closing price almost identical of our closing price today. This day also marked the beginning of the runup to $22.\n\nwe have a closing price and RSI to match the beginning of the runup however our OBV is already as high as it was at the peak.... this indicates to me that we have a very likely probability that this run up will be more violent and has more power behind it than the previous run up.\n\nThis is the sort of technical analysis that many professional traders would use to enter what they would call a high conviction trade setup. Most would enter here with a price target of $22 and a stop loss of $3.70 and never look again until the either the price target or stop loss was reached.\n\nlastly the candlestick pattern is bullish as hell. we have a bullish engulfing on friday, monday met with high resistance and insane volume, my guess is market makers delta hedged their $5 calls they have sold and proceded to short the price immediately after. Today leaves us a bullish hammer.\n\nI think we will see a few high volume days met with quite a bit of short fire power but it should be obvious as to the direction of the price. No one can be sure but because of the monday volume i would guess the $5,$6 calls have been delta hedged at this point therefore we likely wont breakout completely until we push over $8 with volume. $8 strike calls has a ton of open interest and i highly doubt those calls have been hedged.\n\nIm betting now, we see a price real close to $8 by end of the week and next week we breakout.</td>

Now there's a new bad boy at the market : ViacomCBS inc. ( VIAC ),** \n\nViacom itself is global media and entertainment company, it was founded only 2 years ago in late 2019, and has a number of major properties like the CBS Entertainment Group (consisting of the CBS television network, television stations, and other CBS-branded assets), and even well known us cable tv networks including MTV, Nickelodeon, BET, comedy central and showtime. \n\nThey fuckin own SpongeBob guys, this is a no brainer, Mr Krabs is the best god dam business man I've ever seen. Anyway, they've seen an explosive increase in profits with a recorded net income of just over, well just take a look for yourself :\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n[sweet goodness](https://preview.redd.it/hugwsjbh6zk71.png?width=854&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=179a24363f076872d5de3ed9214222a44f37aa08)\n\nNow a lotta the plays here are for meme stocks, which although points to increased volatility, has an incredible amount of risk, BUT Viacom is a member of the S&amp;amp;P so even if it does somehow fuck its face on the pavement, it’ll recover eventually. ( that is if you buy and don't use options )\n\nHowever I don't think it will be wiping out any time soon considering its earnings, as they are looking pretty nice. Now let's  take a look at a bit more reliable source ( it's not the pinnacle of stock advice but it's sure as shit better then whatever you were gonna pick ) Yahoo Finance which gives some tasty stats\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k1by42k07zk71.png?width=819&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2f4c44f7854dc7be0ef271874148a6c99287c4a5\n\n**This mamma jamma is set to increase 27% in just one year based on its earnings alone** and it's also stated to be undervalued by yahoo if the previous earning reports weren’t enough for you. \n\nNow I can keep going about how this is both a fairly safe and lucrative investment but I bet only the big IQ boys have made it this far so I'll leave ya my \*mentioned sources so you can do all the extra research you would like.\n\n* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VIAC?p=VIAC&amp;amp;.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VIAC?p=VIAC&amp;amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)\n* [https://www.google.com/search?q=viac+earnings&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHZN\_enUS918US918&amp;amp;oq=viac+earnings&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l9.2233j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=viac+earnings&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHZN_enUS918US918&amp;amp;oq=viac+earnings&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l9.2233j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8)\n* And the website : [https://www.viacomcbs.com/](https://www.viacomcbs.com/)\n\nALSO, it has an ex dividend date of Sep 14, so if you're into that kind of stuff you best move that booty.

      <td>Good morning degenerates, autists, and intellectually deficients.\n\nI have been lurking on this sub for the longest time, occasionally making some money on the juicy DDs posted here. Today, I felt like giving back by shining some light on 2 companies that have seemingly been forgotten by our community (retards typically have poor working memory, so you are forgiven). I can't write for shit, so here are some facts in bullet points detailing each play (fundamentals and catalysts/reason to bag hold).\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n# Proterra\n\n**Fundamentals :**\n\n* NTM TEV / Revenues = 4.88\n* NTM TEV / EBITDA = 23.10\n* Liabilities as a percentage of TEV = 34.1%\n* Mean street target (tip ranks) = 15.50 (46,78% upside, backed by BofA and Citigroup)\n\n**Catalyst :**\n\n* Infrastructure bill baby. $39 billion USD for public transit, with around $7.5 going directly towards replacing buses. Biggest competitor of PTRA on the EV bus market is a chinese company. Thankfully, a NDAA that was passed in a bipartisan fashion a year ago provides a restriction on funding to be used from a federal transit agency to a Chinese owned or operated company.\n* What specific aspects of the infrastructure bill might advantage PTRA (according to John Allen in the 08-11-2021 press release) :\n   * $800 million a year for 5 years guaranteed\n   * $2.5 billion, up to $5 billion for electric school buses\n   * $2.25 billion to electrify the ports\n   * $7.5 billion for charging infrastructure\n\n**Good reasons to buy in general :**\n\n* Only american EV bus company that also sells charging infrastructure, batteries, and powertrain\n   * Partnership with Thomas (school buses), LG (battery components), Vanhool (coaches), Frieghtliner (delivery trucks), Optimal EV (airport and hospital transit), Komatsu (construction equipment), Lightning motors (sprinter vans)\n* 2 decades of experience in a very young market with plenty of space to grow\n   * Bus with the biggest battery capacity and milage (300-ish miles compared to european buses with 100-200 miles)\n* Politically indifferent\n   * Conservative = protectionism = good for American PTRA\n   * Liberals = weird taxes on carbon emitting businesses = good for PTRA\n\n**The play :**\n\n* Expect a bump in price and price targets when the infrastructure deal passes.\n* Hold that shit till 2035\n\n# Paya Holdings, Inc.\n\n**Fundamentals :**\n\n* NTM TEV / Revenues = 5.05\n* NTM TEV / EBITDA = 18.22\n* Liabilities as a percentage of TEV = 61.7%\n* Mean street target (tip ranks) = 14.50 (44.71% upside, backed by Morgan Stanley, Truist, BTIG)\n\n**Catalyst :**\n\n* Voting to cut warrant-sponsored dilution from 17.7 mil shares to 4.6 mil shares happening on september 10.\n\n**Good reasons to buy in general :**\n\n* Very good multiples for a double digit growth company compared to peers (Paypal, Square, etc.).\n* Profitable as fuck @ 25.7% EBITDA margins\n* Institutions buying up like crazy with zero institution holding a net short position.\n* IV low as hell.\n\n**The play :**\n\n* Expect a bump in price on September 10.\n* Hold or sell that shit after it pops to 15$. You do you.\n\nProof of positions in comments.\n\n**8000 shares of PAYA @ 10.42 + 100 Sep17'21 10C @ 1.05**\n\n**6000 shares of PTRA @ 11.08**\n\n*Edit: I forgot the rockets 🚀</td>
