      <td>So I’ve noticed a ton of you crayon eating degenerates posting CLOV yolo’s and positions. I understand a majority of this sub has learning disabilities but I still can’t wrap my head around why you guys like this stock. Their financials are pretty terrible, their product is pretty bad and other than Chamath there’s pretty much no institutions bag holding this stock. Is it just a GME/AMC type thing where you guys are buying for no reason other than the name? \n\nGenuinely wondering how people rationalize holding CLOV.</td>

      <td>Okay guys. I'm coming to ask you for advice, because I'm seriously running out of options here.\n\nIt started out when she first "officially" became my girlfriend. Obviously I was happy because I thought there was a chance of me finally not being a virgin anymore. But she didn't want to have sex with me.\n\nThan I though to myself: cool, maybe she wants to wait until were married. So skip forward a few years... And I proposed to here. I had small hope that proposing would be enough... but it wasn't. So marrying it is then.\n\nNope. Too bad. When we got married she still did not want to hit the schlong. I thought, okay than, maybe she just needs a little bit more time. So I waited.\n\nThan after a year or so we got kids. Two beautiful handsome boys. This is when I REALLY thought we would finally have sex. But still no action.\n\nSo now to the current time. Our kids are currently almost ready to get out of the house. Is that when she finally wants to have sex with me? I don't want to be a virgin anymore guys.\n\nDo you guys have any tips? Please help me out here.\n\nEdit: Too make things clearer. No we did not adopt our kids.</td>

      <td>Many of you are DD writers and all of you are DD readers. We all know how the typical DD goes:\n\n&amp;gt; Stock XYZ has been trading sideways but in D days their P patent will be approved and... \n\n&amp;gt; They have great fundamentals and have John Doe as their CEO. With experienced leadership, they could...\n\n&amp;gt; XYZ has had solid customer acquisition growth in the past year, and it's only now beginning to show up in these results. This will alert investors that XYZ is...\n\n\nThis kind of talk is usually the majority of every DD post. However, this purely traditional way of doing due diligence is simply not enough for a truly transcendental DD. \n\nThere are millions of Wallstreet traders every day looking at companies. Someone is always going to have more financial experience in this space than you. To actually make a successful play need to have *individual insight*. Something that *you know* that the rest of Wallstreet does not. This is what actually makes great DD's more than anything else.\n\n&amp;amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**What is II (individual insight)**? It's an intuitive understanding of the world that *you have*, but that most other people do not. \n\nYou have this knowledge about *how something really is* that the majority does not already know. This is the foundation of a profitable strategy.\n\n&amp;amp;nbsp;\n\nExamples (from worst to best):\n\n1. \n         \n  &amp;gt; **II:** My uncle has a Tesla and I got to ride in it. It was super fast, EV's really are the real deal. TSLA &amp;amp; GOEV 🚀🚀🚀\n\n  Even something as simple and 🦍🧠'd as this counts. This person had an experience that many investors still would not have had, and thus has some personal intuition about the EV space that is uncommon. The reason this is the *worst* example here, is because most people already know how great EVs are, but it still counts.\n\n2. \n         \n  &amp;gt; **II:** I'm a Type 1 Diabetic and have recently tried a new glucose monitoring product from SENS. This was a huge improvement to my life, SENS all the way!\n\n  This II is even better and it's obvious why. Far fewer people are Type 1 Diabetics, and it's not even an experience that can be attained by the layman. As strange as it sounds to say, this person was *born* with this individual insight.\n\n3. \n         \n  &amp;gt; **II:** I worked for a pool cleaning company for 30 years. Therefore, I know how important Chlorine is for maintaining a healthy pool. Because of the recent shortage of Chlorine, and the need to clean pools, Chlorine alternatives such as saltwater will have increased buying pressure. $HAYW pool equipment company controls the production of these alternatives.\n\n  *Niche jobs* like working for a pool company is going to give this person insight that few other people have. **Most good II is going to come from personal specializations** like this. What do you know of the world that most people do not?\n\n&amp;amp;nbsp;\n\nAs important as II is, it's important to not *overemphasize* one singular company unless it makes sense to do so. If you're bullish on a company due to some II, it still needs to be the *cherry on top* of an otherwise already healthy company. \n\n**TL:DR** - Please include II (individual insight) as part of your DD. If you don't have any, it may be time to reconsider just how lucrative your DD post really is.</td>

      <td>Hey retards, \n\nso ending normal funnies and jokes- here’s something that you all will need to understand and hopefully help you on your tax understanding. \n\nNow it won’t be much fun to read it but knowing it may be helpful to you at some point.\n\n1) what is wash sale rule? \n\n&amp;gt;A wash sale occurs when an investor sells or trades a security at a loss, and within 30 days before or after, buys another one that is substantially similar.\n\nNow the actual way to understanding this is kind of complex and even out of the scope of this post. You can be held at a tax higher than your gain (some retard got a 800k tax bill in a 40k gain because of wash sale rule since he was trading same stocks 10+ times a day). \n\nBut do know that this rule, is made to stop shady things. It usually won’t effect you because brokerages are smart enough to realize it and do mathematical calculation to your second buy to fix the wash sale rule instantly. But there can be mistakes. \n\nNOTE: you should only be paying taxes on your actual gain and deducting from your all losses (total after net year). If anything is wrong, see tax accountant instantly. \n\n2)  tax-loss harvesting\n\nThis is like algebra math where you try to add and subtract to get the best number. Say you have 2 positions, one in AMD and one in GME. You realized a gain (so you closed your position) on AMD but still have your GME options chugging along. Your GME options don’t expire until next year but they are in loss. It’s December- so you say “wait, rather than pay full tax on my gains from AMD, why don’t I close my GME positions for a loss and now I can subtract that loss from my AMD gain and pay less tax”. \n\nThis also hopefully makes it clear why the wash sale rule is there. Because someone could be this at dec 31, and buy the same position at same rate in jan 1, and theoretically from tax point, essentially mitigated all loss on that GME position. \n\n3) deduction of capital loss\n\nYou say you have -20k realized loss in 2020. You can deduct 3000$ from your earned income every year until that 20k is used up. This means you lost 20k in stocks but made 60k in your job- you can automatically deduct 3000 from your income so now you effectively have a 57,000$ income for tax. \n\nNow some people are confused but this is only for EARNED INCOME. The 3000 deduction limit is so it’s not abused. But say you have 2021 capital gain from GME of 15k. \n\nHere if you still had -20k loss of 2020, you can deduct the full 15k gain from 2021 so that -20k loss now is at 5k loss and use the remaining 3000 from 5k to deduct the earned income (from job) of 2021. For a total net loss of -2k still left for next year. \n\n4) positions that you hold for less than 1 year will be taxed at higher % than positions held more than year. \n\nThere are more Things like Tax-optimized Portfolio and many other tax implication that are too far out of reach for a single post but be aware of all these things. \n\nSPY 460c 9/10- free money</td>

      <td>Hello fellow Space Chimps, all brain sizes and textures are welcome to ponder this investment opportunity. You may have heard about this actual rocket company going public last month. I'm here to give you the low down and how you may like to strategize getting in. \n\nTLDR\nI've been in this stock since April and [this](https://youtu.be/vktA6ccXZUk) video that just came out is by far the best summary for you 🤏🧠 🐵. He gets everything right that is current(I'm a tough critic on this), and gives ol Bezos a few epic burns. \n\nNow for my two cents.\n\nUpcoming events I know about. \n9/7 Bloomberg presentation with CEO Peter Beck\n\n9/8 The first investor meeting since the merger, q2 financials released \n\n9/10 Deutsche Bank presentation with Beck \n\nSometime later this month and October *\n3 missions for Blacksky, the big thing about this is proving rapid launch capabilities. Something you learn early in this industry is it's a logistical nightmare. You have to stop air travel and marine shipping in the area. So there's a new race to see who can launch the most often. PAUSE. Think about quarterly reports or the rare monthly dividend. Now imagine a company that launches once a month, then two times, and eventually once a week. PLAY\n\n(Oct. Subject to change) They are going moon adjacent.There is a big operation in the works(Artemis)to go back to the moon with many company's collaborating on the project. Rocketlab is set to kick things off with a satellite mission this October. This is an opportunity for them to prove themselves to NASA for more important missions in the future. Important = big dollar contracts. Don't you want to reinvest in your NASA tax dollars? They also have bid on/won/and delivered on contracts for the State Department(tax money towards innovation), Department of Defense(tax money towards safety), and the Space Force(tax money towards memes). And ALSO the DoD subsidizes companies like Lockheed Martin, LM invested in RL during the round B private capital fundraising. To put a fine point on it, they have built up a good relation in beneficial places.\n\nThen the big news a lot of people are waiting for is the reveal of the Neutron design. I'm not going to guess when that is going to happen. You're going to learn quick that the Electron is just a lil fella compared to what else is in the industry. Neutron should satisfy you ladies and gentlemen that are all about size.  Beck has a history of fun surprises. When first raising capital for Electron he didn't show up to the pitch meeting with a power point presentation, he actually had the electric turbo pump part for the proposed engine. I'm speculating after checking his personal Twitter that a similar story is going to happen, this ones just between us space chimps. I thought the announcement would have been at the completion of the merger, so I don't always get it right. This is a good time to let you know this is not financial advise.\n\nWhat might sound like vague financial advise is don't everyone try and pile through the door all at once. This gem just had a hot two days so do your homework. If you're north of 30 years old you need to diversify your YOLO's. You have less energy and less time in life to recuperate, I don't want you to become Dave Thomas' bottom bitch. Consider an entry strategy knowing all the potential catalysts I gave. Wednesday could show the short term trend of the stock until we get back to work. If you know what a leap is, consider RKLB/W, but study the dark arts before practicing the dark arts. Remember exit strategies are just as much a thing as dollar cost averaging.\n\nDid he say get back to work?\n\n*oh yeah, that is the company got started in New Zealand, and they in are in lockdown. Particularly the major city the main factory is in. So we are waiting for news for them to get back to work. Last I heard they had a couple days with rates lowering. I expect to get to launching shortly after. Puts opportunity for you rainbow chimps.\n\nI know I'm poking the troll by saying this, but two things. First, this industry is notorious for delays, don't cry to Rocketlab "wen moon" every chance you get. The CEO is pretty dope, let him get the job done. If you're getting impatient start your own rocket company. Second its a joint effort, Muricans and Kiwis, we need each other to make this thing thrive. Don't t try to take credit for something you didn't even contribute in. \n\nFull disclosure I have shares and warrants and a high school diploma, and I'm half bull and half chimp.\n\nRocketlabs [homepage ](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/)\n\nRocketlabs [factories](https://youtu.be/KKHiPf8cEFk)\n\nNow I'm going to go mow my lawn and hope I get abducted by some adorable aliens. Everyone have a good Labor Day weekend. ☮ out🛸</td>

      <td>First you should look at [the M1 money supply data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL). \n\nIf you adjust the S&amp;amp;P500 by the total dollars available it’s actually at one of the lowest points it’s been in the last 20 years. If you compare some other numbers like US income in terms of food prices, it turns out the growth the country has experienced over the last 20 years has been mostly to due with increased prices and money supply and less to due with rising productivity in general.\n\nSo with the vast amount of money printed in the last year as well as the 4.7 trillion dollars of new spending being introduced between Biden’s budget proposal and the infrastructure bill, this means we have a ways to go until we are back at the highs seen before COVID. So much more new money is still on the sidelines and additional new money is being shoveled into big companies which will eventually find its way into stock buybacks. Everyone in congress in on board with this plan. Real wages are still declining, bond yields are criminally low, this all leaves a higher percentage of the money supply for equities and assets than there was in the past. So just ride the equity wave upward with as much long term leverage as you can. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? With all this new money in circulation is there any way it could come crashing down, or are 🌈🐻 fuk?</td>

Shares I’m probably holding long term but I’m planning on buying some far out calls this week and would love to hear opinions even tho I’m pretty set in stone about what I’m doing this week.

      <td>I am very much into being involved with the market today but, I am poor as dirt. I realized if I want to make income short term. I need a lot more money to invest with. Meanwhile, I practice with a million dollars on a simulated app called invstr. If I had a million dollars I know for a fact I can at least get 190k - 340k return every quarter. That’s based on the hacked up strategy , if I can call it that, I basically invented. Simply by using common sense and learning how to read technical data. My next goal is to automate my strategy. Anyways, I digress, I am in real life,  “poor”, I don’t see how I can get myself up to a million dollars when all my checks are always said for two weeks before I know my pay that week. I have 215$ on one stock that costs 5.36 I know it’s bad practice for not diversifying but I’m looking for income in the short term. Any help? Advice or blogs I can read?</td>
