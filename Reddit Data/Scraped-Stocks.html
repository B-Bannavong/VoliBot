      <td>While Affirm focuses on targeting prime borrowers to lower their risk and achieve a healthy, low risk balance sheet, they don't turn away subprime borrowers with bad credit. Katapult Holdings is a subprime fintech company that provides credit in a lease-to-own format and is partnered with Affirm in the Affirm Connect ecosystem.\n\nBoth companies share the same transparency format when giving out a loan, as opposed to the fine print and hidden fees of credit card companies. When Affirm gets a request from  borrowers who are not prime, instead of turning them away they send the customer to Katapult. They get a fee while Katapult takes on the client and assumes the loan and the risk involved with it (subprime).\n\nWhile Katapult doesn't have access to all Affirms clients, that is because they are not needed to a large extent in the current Affirm ecosystem. Peloton represents 1/3 of Affirm's revenue, and people who buy $2500 overpriced static bikes are not subprime borrowers.\n\nOne example of the Affirm - Katapult partnership can be seen in Gazelle, a marketplace that sells electronic goods and is partnered with Affirm.\n\n[https://buy.gazelle.com/pages/financing](https://buy.gazelle.com/pages/financing)\n\nIn this page you can see that if the customer is not approved by Affirm they get a chance with Katapult. The partnership is beneficial to both sides, as Affirm is able to make succulent commissions from subprime borrowers (much, much higher than prime borrowers) while having 0 risk on their balance sheet.\n\nWith the recent Amazon deal, questions have been raised whether Katapult would be in or left out of the deal, whether Affirm would send "bad" customers to Katapult or simply turn them away.\n\nSubprime has a bad reputation, not only because it was one of the prime reasons for the 2008 global financial meltdown, but because subprime customers are often abused with predatory rates from lending companies who  take advantage of them as their only option. But the truth is that Katapult is the opposite of that. While rates are high (in order to compensate for defaults), customers are given 3 friendly options to pay their loan and  all of these options are transparently presented to them before they take on the loan. This has earned them a 4.4 stars (out of 5) in TrustPilot based on more than 15.000 reviews.\n\nGiven that Katapult is not some shady abuser lending company with hidden fees and fine prints, Affirm decided to partner with them around 2019 in order to get exposure to the subprime market without taking on any risk. But the million dollar question is, will Katapult receive Amazon customers from Affirm?\n\nOf course nobody knows and the question will probably get answered in Affirm earnings call (Wednesday of next week).\n\nBut, with 35% of America being subprime, one thing is for sure. Affirm will get thousands of subprime applications on Amazon, and it will be up to them to accept  and redirect those into Katapult or simply turn them away. Taking into consideration that prime borrowers are much less profitable than subprime, Affirm would be a fool to turn them away, since for them is basically free money with 0 risk.\n\nJust to understand how profitable subprime borrowers are, Katapult made $22M  profit on 220M revenues in 2020, while Affirm lost -$112M with $509M revenues in 2020.\n\nGiven Affirm rich valuation, any additional revenue that helps boost the bottom line should be more than welcomed, and the partnership with Katapult is a no brainer. They will get juicy commissions in the biggest e-commerce platform from subprime borrowers while simultaneously adding 0 additional risk to their balance sheet.</td>

      <td>I have products in big box stores and the current freight prices/delays are putting everyone's Q4 inventory at risk. I've heard from several big brands that they no doubt will be limited in what they can put on the shelf this holiday and into Q1, if not longer. Most still have enough product to meet current demand, but holiday will reveal the shortages that have been bubbling up for months. I assume retailers will issue significantly lower guidance after holiday, and retail will sell off for quarter or two. Does retail have enough sway to trigger something larger, or will traders simply rotate into something else?</td>

      <td>The Tesla Cybertruck delay was already a known fact, but CEO Elon Musk's latest reported comments add a few more details to the picture. Citing sources familiar with the meeting, Electrek reported Thursday that Musk held a company-wide call and said the Cybertruck should be ready for production in late 2022.\n\nIf the company plans for beta trucks later this year, that leaves nowhere near enough time to start actual production in late 2021.\n\nFollowing his comments, Tesla updated the Cybertruck's reservation page to note production will fire up in 2022. Though, according to Musk, we're not looking at early 2022 or anything like that. And as we suspected, the CEO underscored the electric truck's volume models may not be ready until sometime in 2023. If Tesla follows this timeline, we'll get the priciest tri-motor model in 2022, then the dual- and single-motor trucks in 2023.\n\nLink: [https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-production-delay-elon-musk/](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-production-delay-elon-musk/)\n\nElon Musk confirmed that Tesla has delayed the new Roadster program to 2023, and even then, that’s only going to happen with a big “if.”  \nThe new electric hypercar is now three years behind its original timeline.  \nWhen first unveiling the next-generation Tesla Roadster in 2017, Musk said that it will come to market in 2020.\n\nTesla started taking reservations for the impressive electric supercar with a 0-60 mph in 1.9 seconds and over 600 miles of range at the unveiling event.  \nPeople who wanted to be first in line to get the vehicle had to put down between $50,000 and $250,000 in deposits.  \nThe vehicle program was later delayed, as the CEO said that it wasn’t a priority for Tesla.\n\nLink: [https://electrek.co/2021/09/01/tesla-delays-new-roadster-2023/](https://electrek.co/2021/09/01/tesla-delays-new-roadster-2023/)</td>

      <td>EDIT: Removed all mention of stock tickers to comply with Rule 7! This is just for learning! No ticker mentions please! DOn't get me banned! \n\n\----------------\n\nI made a post yesterday trying to buy shares of delisted stock (basically Blockbuster and Sears ) but it was removed. Maybe because it was considered penny cuz it was, duh, worth pennies! SORRY MODS!\n\nTrying to continue that question/topic so I can learn better: I know I cannot buy these shares (bummer!). But is it common for delisted companies that retail cannot buy to jump up so big? I mean, these companies are "bankrupt" and facing liquidation, so they technically should not go up at all. Whatever is remaining should be sold to pay down debt, etc. In fact, if facing liquidation, why are they trading in the first place? Retail cannot buy in, so, who is gaining from BLIAQ and SHLDQ going up?\n\n\-------------------\n\nNOTE: I'm dating myself here, but I loved Blockbuster when it was around. Even before streaming, with Netflix mail in DVDs, I still went to my local Blockbuster to check out videos and rent videos and videogames. So yea, it wasn't 'dying' to me, which might be a small niche population. I still go to my local book store to buy my books and in my company, we always try to purchase from small businesses first.\n\nNOTE: "To protect investors" was a lot of comments previously; but I had positions in BABA and also VIAC and I did not feel protected when it plummeted, so now I'm calloused and put money aside for these "stock bets" (not options), even if it's just a few k.\n\nNOTE: People telling me to just put it into index / ETFs; yes, I have those too. I'm not looking for 7-10% a year. I'm looking for some quick buck or two to feed into my FIRE. Happy with making 2-3% a month, but have been doing roughly 8-9% monthly. Also, these are for my leisure trading hobby. In at open, out when my target is reached , around 30-40%. Sometimes, I don't hold more than a day or two. I have a day job which is pretty stress free and gives me time to day trade (and learn about stuff).\n\nNOTE: Amazon vs (anyone): Yes, I saw the post in the other subreddit. This is NOT about that. My household does not have Prime, but I do give props to them for giving small businesses a store front to sell product, much like what eBay did many moons ago.\n\nNOTE: Thank you to folks sending me to that video game stock. I read the Due Diligence there. This is NOT about that.\n\nMODS: I mark this as industry discussion to learn more. Let me know if this question is out of place or which words to remove and I'll edit!!!!</td>
