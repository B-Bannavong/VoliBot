      <td>"Cloudflare said its system managed to stop the largest reported DDoS attack in July, explaining in a blog post that the attack was 17.2 million requests-per-second, three times larger than any previous one they recorded. \n\n"In a blog post, Cloudflare's Omer Yoachimik explained that the company serves over 25 million HTTP requests per second on average in 2021 Q2, illustrating the enormity of the attack. \n\n"He added that the attack was launched by a botnet that was targeting a financial industry customer of Cloudflare. It managed to hit the Cloudflare edge with over 330 million attack requests within seconds, he said. \n\n"'The attack traffic originated from more than 20 000 bots in 125 countries around the world. Based on the bots' source IP addresses, almost 15% of the attack originated from Indonesia, and another 17% from India and Brazil combined. Indicating that there may be many malware-infected devices in those countries," Yoachimik said. \n\n"This 17.2 million rps attack is the largest HTTP DDoS attack that Cloudflare has ever seen to date and almost three times the size of any other reported HTTP DDoS attack. This specific botnet, however, has been seen at least twice over the past few weeks. Just last week, it also targeted a different Cloudflare customer, a hosting provider, with an HTTP DDoS attack that peaked just below 8 million rps."\n\nSource: [ZDnet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cloudflare-says-it-stopped-the-largest-ddos-attack-ever-reported/)</td>

      <td>ARK Investment Management is looking to debut a new ETF that will focus on transparency in companies and shun vice and sectors that run afoul of ESG investing like fossil fuels.\n\nIn an SEC filing, Cathie Wood's shop outlines the fund, which looks to be at least 80% invested in stocks in its benchmark Transparency Index, published by Solactive.\n\n"Companies operating in the following industries, as determined by the Index provider, are excluded from the Index: (i) alcohol, (ii) banking, (iii) chemicals, (iv) confectionary, (v) fossil fuel transportation, (vi) gambling, (vii) metals, (viii) mineral, (ix) natural gas, (x) oil, and (xi) tobacco," ARK says in its filing.\n\nIf approved, the ETF would be the second that Ark has launched this year. In March, the company started a fund focused on space-related investments, which has risen about 4% since its debut and now has more than $600 million in assets. Meanwhile, the firm’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up to $22.5 billion, although it’s down 2% year-to-date -- compared with a gain of more than 20% for the S&amp;amp;P 500.</td>

      <td>Good morning all,\n\nAs part of DD, I usually take a look at the insider buys and sells of a company. Usually, if I see quite a few buys and not a lot of insider trading in general, I take it as a bit of confirmation on top of my initial research.\n\nMy question is, how deeply should we consider these insider trades? If we see someone like a company director selling off a few shares, should we consider it a bad thing? Of course, many sell off perhaps because they need money here and there (for eg, Jeff Bezos with Amazon a few months back), but at what stage does the insider activity become a negative indicator of the company?</td>

      <td>\nBare with me, a lot to uncover. \n\nI work in a drywall company and there has been constant price increases for MATERIAL over the past year starting since almost October of last year.\n\nDrywall, aluminum, lumber, insulation are all receiving price increases from the manufacturers.\n\nPart of the reason we saw material increases was so manufacturers could make up losses from COVID. Seems like they realized how much money they can make off of this and kept up the price increases, even if they broke even with the first increase. \n\nToday, we had our weekly meeting and our boss, owner of the company, was telling us that Mcstain Neighborhoods, a builder in Denver, CO has stopped their building because they weren’t making any money on the last 5 houses they built. According to my boss, they had to write $20,000 checks in order to complete the house, racking up to a whopping $100,000 with just 5 houses.\n\nHere’s why I wanna buy puts (not sure how far out though) \n\nBuilders are selling houses BEFORE they’re built, on fixed prices. \n\nBut the house is already more expensive to build DURING production, resulting in a profit loss from the builder because they are now paying to build this house.\n\nExample:\n\n- Buyer picks a house model. Cost to build this house is $250,000\n\n- House sold at $400,000 - builder can’t change price.\n\n- Constant price increases changed the build cost from $250,000 to $420,000. \n\n- Builder pays $20,000 to finish the house. \n\nHere we see one builder slow down its building because they are losing money when the house is closed. Building permits are DOWN 35% from last year. Building has been slowing down and it’s only a matter of time until it comes to a halt.\n\nHow many more builders are going to follow? \n\nHow many builders right NOW are talking about slowing down building? \n\nIs this priced in?!?!??\n\nEvery month, there is a new price for our drywall, EVERY MONTH. \n\nMy prediction: Builders will come to a halt sometime in the next year, I’d be surprised if it hasn’t stopped by April of next year. These houses are getting too expensive to build and the builders who own all the land, are stopping production.\n\nMany things are going to happen here. \n\nMaterials for building will lose demand. Very very fast. \n\nPeople are going to temporarily lose jobs until prices come back down. \n\nProfits are gonna be off the table, who’s making money if there’s no work happening?!? Builders don’t wanna pay that expensive Material! No material. No House. \n\nBUT, is this infrastructure bill only going to cause more inflation? Is every aspect of building going to be affected by the infrastructure bill? Only a few?\n\nPlease, be my guest and throw down some tract home builders, commercial builders, any that have a public traded stock. \n\nSo far, we work with Century Communities (CCS) , they are one of our builders with a publicly traded stock. Their price is sitting at $70.\n\nI would like to buy 6-8 month put contracts on this stock because im expecting building to slow down, and im expecting profits to fall off. \n\nBut is this already priced in? \n\nThere’s money to be made during this transition of builders fighting against manufacturer pricing, but I would like some input on where you guys would put your money if building does happen to come to a halt. \n\nSide note: if you looked at my profile, you’d see I’ve made some dumb investments that my 19 year old self isn’t too proud of. But I do eventually hope to seek a good understanding of the market and here I am witnessing the fuse getting closer to the bomb and trying to make money off of it. \n\nTLDR; Materials to build a house is getting expensive. Builders are starting to slow down their building until prices come back down. This may create a domino effect and cause many jobs to be off the grid temporarily. Puts on builder companies, material manufacturers, and all those rich corporations that build is my guess, not financial advice.</td>

      <td>Let’s start it off with Lightspeed’s mission statement from their S-1:\n\n&amp;gt;At Lightspeed, our mission is to bring cities and communities to life by powering small and medium-sized businesses (“**SMBs**”). We believe cities and communities are built on the presence and success of local SMBs and that these businesses are integral to the vibrancy of their communities. Running an independent business, however, is becoming increasingly complex. Consumer behaviors and expectations are changing, fueled by the influence of new technologies pushing consumers towards an omni-channel experience. Our solutions equip independent businesses with the technology required to transform the way they manage their operations and exceed consumers’ expectations in this changing environment.\n\nLightspeed Commerce, formerly known as Lightspeed POS, is a one-stop-shop for all things commerce in the retail, restaurant and golf spaces. Founded in 2005 by CEO Dax Dasilva in Montreal, Canada, Lightspeed started out as an iPad point-of-sales (POS) operating system (OS) that has evolved quite a bit since then into a cloud-based ecosystem.\n\nLightspeed Commerce is a dual listed company, where they first IPO’d on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) at a $1.4B valuation raising $240M CAD or about $111M USD in May of 2019. Lightspeed then IPO’d on the New York Stock Exchange at a $5.9B valuations raising $332M in gross proceeds in September of 2020.\n\nLightspeed is right in the middle of the covid accelerated trend of omni-channel commerce, which basically means a software solution supporting different buying channels such as Brick-and-Mortar, Online, Curbside Pickup &amp;amp; Delivery, Order Ahead, Mobile Apps or even open source APIs.\n\nThis was something that wasn’t necessarily needed for most retail SMBs, boutique shops or fancy restaurants, but since the pandemic this has changed. CEO Dax Dasilva likes to say about omni-channel commerce “it went from nice to have, ***to must have***\*”.\*\n\nSpaceX HQ was recently announced as customers!\n\n**Bull Case**\n\n* Lightspeed ecosystem offerings bring a rare moat in a commoditized product (POS solutions) with their high switching costs if one were to seek these services separately, bringing a long road of ARPU expansion\n* Lightspeed customers continue to buy new modules for locations and cross sell new offerings\n* ShopKeep Capital replaces their existing Lightspeed Capital partnership with Stripe which is much more profitable in-house\n* Lightspeed continues to convert legacy system users over to their cloud-based offerings\n* Lightspeed Payments continues to see positive traction and build upon their current 10% Lightspeed customers penetration as they continue to expand regional offering. **Lightspeed Payments brings a bottom line GTV take rate of 0.65% versus their third party 0.25% take rate.**\n* Lightspeed K-Series offerings for U.S. Restaurants is a large success, and they roll it out globally\n* Lightspeed creates a similar bundling of all their best tech like K-Series for the retail space and roll that out globally\n* Lightspeed’s significant R&amp;amp;D investments are successful in creating new revenue streams\n* Lightspeed is founder lead for over 15 years, where the CEO has a 10%+ stake in the company\n\n**Bear Case**\n\n* Lightspeed never grows into their lofty valuation\n* Execution risks of creating the synergies across acquired companies\n* Lightspeed fails to gain market share from fierce competition\n* Lightspeed projected margins decrease needing to stay competitive (commoditized product in POS solutions)\n* Lightspeed dilutes shareholders further negating company progress for equity holders.\n\nI'm personally extremely excited to own this stock for many years to come. Although not cheap I don't think this stock will ever look it due to the large TAM its attacking with such a compelling runway. Currently my largest position at 26% of my portfolio, first buy at 77, average now at 89. \n\nI have a much longer writeup on this company but not sure how "promotion" rules work here truly</td>
