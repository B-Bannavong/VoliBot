      <td>Alright, all caught up on why the fundamentals and cash flow generation make BGFV a fundamentals ATM? If not, put your La Croix and the September Good Housekeeping down and read for 5 minutes:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/pelvo1/bgfv\_irrational\_market\_has\_passed\_this\_one\_by\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/pelvo1/bgfv_irrational_market_has_passed_this_one_by_i/)\n\nThere has been a material shift in something important here that you NEED to follow: September call open interest and the possible setup of a gamma/short cover cycle. But let's recap for about 10 minutes first:\n\nRemember a few points from BGFV 101: \n\n**Low float with high institutional ownership:** 19.66 million share float, 56% institutional ownership at the end of Q2 (probably higher now). Why do we care? Most of these institutions are made up of **GIANT** ETFs and Russell index funds. They are not watching the tickers daily waiting for the right moment to buy or sell. They are building multi billion dollar portfolios that balance out market risk or track as a proxy to a certain sector or index. The ELI5 there: **Most of these are not selling any time soon!** Oh, and another point boys and girls. As stocks grow in market cap, they become eligible for inclusion in more indices and more ETFs that may have minimum market caps for inclusion. This can add fuel to a growth fire as more and more funds want a piece of a rising small cap that they couldn't previously add. Look at the funds buying in Q2: [https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/bgfv/ownership](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/bgfv/ownership)\n\nNotice a trend? Most of the largest funds adding are Russell 2000 funds from a previous position of 0. BGFV was re-added to the Russell 2000 and just like that, \~1,000,000 shares get snapped up. Microcap funds or others may drop it, and some did. But fund ownership almost always increases with market cap, especially as they gain membership in more large indicies. Gains beget more tutes buying in and high velocity share supply contracts.\n\n***Shares in play impact:*** We're at 56% now, but let's shave a few points off and say that we'll assume 40% of issuance owned right now excluding recent moves since reporting and high turnover funds. I think it is likely to move up from 56% the longer we hold over $500 million and future market cap milestones. But I'll invoke the Santorum rule and go conservative. \n\n40% of issuance = 9 million shares unlikely to move in the short term. 19.66 million float drops to \~10.6 million in play.\n\n**Shares on Loan to Shorts:** We don't know where the loaned shares are sourced from for the short interest. But we do know where some of it is NOT. Index and Mutual funds are prohibited by law from loaning out more than 50% of their unlevered positions to lend out to shorts. With \~10 million total with tutes, we can say that in a worst case scenario the shorts borrowed ALL available shares from institutions (5 million out of 7.7 million). \n\nBut that worst case scenario is not reality. Big tutes have reported somewhere in the range of 1-10% of their holdings being loaned out. Vanguard, the biggest dog, I found reported 2% on their largest funds. They could have loaned more of some stocks and less than others. But the interest rate on lending BGFV has been sitting between 0 and 1% for most of 2020/2021, the period when shorts were building their positions. **There was no incentive to loan out more BGFV than anything else in the portfolio. The tutes actual share count lent to shorts is very likely WELL under 1 million.** \n\nSantorum rule: we'll round up to 1 million double counted and pull that out. 7.7 million shorts minus 1 million = 6.7 million shares locked up with brokers not counted in institutional ownership. These shares can only be sold if the lending broker in turn replaces them by pulling from their pool of owned shares (which they likely hold very little BGFV given its small market cap and historical volume) or buying shares on open market to replace them, effectively offsetting the price impact of the selling shareholder. This is NOT a 1:1 removal of shares from the open market, especially if market selling volume takes off. But when more of the pressure is on the buy side with lending brokers and/or volume remains low-ish, it's like a cushion underneath the stock to soften drops from sales of sold shares. That downward price pressure is already baked in when the original short transaction took place.\n\nSo we've got 10.6 million moving around outside the tutes and \~6.7 million market sells worth of downward price pressure already baked in. The market is a weird thing, but we are set up so that only about **4 million** shares in the short term are changing hands in a way that meaningfully impacts the price. \n\n**How many shares are shorted again? Oh, they shorted 7.7 million? Those are going to be tough to close out should upward price movement force your hand. Would be a damn shame if you had to do so at a price significantly over the current market price.**\n\n**Which brings me to my last topic for today: Gamma.** September $30 call interest has grown significantly over the last few trading days. I believe I remember seeing 4,400 on Monday and now see over 7,600 contracts open. That is 760,000 shares that will need to be assigned if all contracts are exercised. That doesn't happen, but open interest is growing so quickly that even a 25% assignment rate at expiration is going to put some seriously **MAGNIFIED** upward price pressure when there may only 4 million shares out there up for grabs. If we clear $35 we are already looking at 3,400 open interest for September (and rising). We could be looking at 500,000+ shares of buy side pressure landing near options expiration date date of September 17th. \n\nNone of this takes in account any of the following:\n\n* Retail is buying this shit up lately. The more retail HODLs, the tighter the supply, the more violent the price action is likely to get. \n* Most of the managers and corporate employees have a VERY long tenure per their last 10-K filing. BGFV has also run an employee stock incentive program for some time. It's hard to say how many are owned by non-insider-reported employees, but it is certainly above zero and possibly immaterial to the very tight supply. How many "*Fred-the-25-year-store-manager-that-has-been-accumulating-since-the-IPO-in-2002-and-won't-sell-until-retirement"* are there taking even more supply off the market that we can't even account for?\n* Synthetics and naked shorts. The supply could be much larger than estimated if a significant share of the shorted shares are synth or naked. My not-financial-advice opinion in this case is: If they aren't synth or naked, fuck 'em and squeeze 'em. And if they are manipulating the supply with naked shorts, fuck 'em even more and sqeeze 'em harder.\n* Shorts commitment to fighting: We aren't talking about tens of billions of dollars with small cap BGFV. Large funds aren't likely to get margin called here. They probably have enough cash to keep their positions funded if they want to fighgt or wait sitting on a huge paper loss. But all it takes is a few big players to say 'fuck this, I'm out. You win Retail' for the window of escape to collapse.\n* What was posted is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in the rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this subreddit is now dumber for having read it. We award you no karma, and may God have mercy on your soul.\n\n**So go read the fundamentals from part 1 again, take a cold shower, and ask yourself if you are ready to strap your goddamn seat belts on and moon this shit.**\n\nNone of this is financial advice. I am not a broker, insider, registered Libertarian, or Costco member. Do not act on my advice alone. I am merely sharing my opinion based on publicly available data. I might be wrong, I might be right, I just may be the lunatic you're looking for.\n\nI like the stock.</td>

      <td>&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n 22nd Century (XXII) Made a Good Choice Bringing the Hop Plant into Its Family of Plants to Modify  \n\n\nWill the FDA Give Traction to Their VLN Cigarettes Soon?  \n\n\nGood day everyone,  \n\n\nWe are continuing coverage on **22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII),** a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.  \n\n\nCurrent price $3.3/share (at 10:00 AM EDT)  \n\n\nAfter closing at $3.57/share in the Tuesday session, XXII shares began looking for a level of support in early trading today. I believe a support level at $3.30/share will bring buyers in and we will see increasing volume and price throughout the day.  \n\n\nRemember, tobacco is still the flagship product at XXII and generates their revenues. For the FDA, the decisions on Juul and other manufacturers could represent a milestone as it tries to execute an ambitious tobacco regulation agenda. The FDA in April said it was taking steps to ban menthol cigarettes. And it continues to work on a potential requirement that nicotine levels in cigarettes be set at minimally addictive levels, a possible game-changer that the White House would need to approve. It’s possible XXII may see a mandate and approval announced together.  \n\n\nThe hop plant market is not as highly regulated as tobacco or hemp/cannabis, providing a faster path to commercialization. If you have followed XXII you know they have been waiting a while for the FDA to approve their ability to advertise their VLN cigarettes as a safer alternative to standard tobacco. We all know that cannabis remains classified as a schedule one drug by the US government.  \n\n\nHop and hemp/cannabis plants have many similarities. Both are part of the Cannabaceae family of alkaloid flowering plants and the active ingredients found in both plants offer potential health benefits for managing anxiety, inducing calm, addressing sleeping disorders and resolving stomach problems, among other wellness applications.  \n\n\nThe fact that hop, and cannabis plants are similar is important because XXII has already done a lot of R&amp;amp;D, including that done by its cannabis partner companies, that may apply to hop plants creating new proprietary plants. Let’s remember that XXII has valuable plant modification IP and know-how including utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other technology they have developed in tobacco and cannabis.  \n\n\nThe hop plant has been grown and used to make beer for centuries (possibly millennia) without modification. XXII has picked a plant to be the third leg in in its plant modification tripod that is ready to be improved and expanded.  \n\n\n  \n**original report below** \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n22nd Century (XXII) Announces the Completion of Its Trifecta of Market Sectors with Tobacco, Cannabis, and Now Hops\n\nMassive IP portfolio on the Tobacco and Cannabis Plants. **Now hops also?** I would say they have all major areas covered. (I will dive more into that later) no pun intended.\n\nGood day everyone,\n\nInitiating coverage on **22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII),** a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.\n\nCurrent price $3.57/share (at market close Aug. 31, 2021)\n\nOn August 16, 2021, XXII moved to the NASDAQ Exchange from the NYSE-American. The company participated in the closing bell ceremony on the same day. The company believes the move will increase their visibility and exposure to investors.\n\nWhen I look at [the company stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=XXII), I see how XXII has come off recent dips this year. On April 26th, the shares peaked at $6.07, then dipped to $3.56 on May 13th. On July 1st the shares had climbed back to $4.63 before consolidating to today’s level. XXII shares have now crossed their 200 DMA of $3.34 and are **approaching their 50 DMA of $3.67/share in a bullish manner**.\n\nI often note insider holdings as a value metric because the insiders have a vested interest in the company’s success. Insider ownership isn’t very high (under 3%) at XXII, but the institutional ownership (all data per YF) is at 36.4% of the outstanding shares. **Some of the big guns are holding XXII shares like Blackrock (5.99%) and Vanguard (4.68%). ETF Managers Group is holding 7.38% of the company’s shares.** Hedge funds prefer the companies they invest in to perform sooner rather than later.\n\nWhen we last covered XXII in July, we talked about the company’s trifecta of core products, tobacco, cannabis, and an unknown third leg. I spent some time trying to figure out what that third product was going to be. Since XXII was already in the tobacco and cannabis sectors I thought the new market would be psilocybin. Boy was I wrong. While psilocybin is an exciting and developing market, it is still relatively small and in it’s infancy. XXII doesn’t chase small markets.\n\nIn a [letter to shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/22nd-century-group-enters-global-132000137.html) published Monday, August 30th, CEO James Mish said “I am proud to announce our third plant-based franchise – the global **specialty hops market**. Like our existing franchises, the hop plant market is ripe for disruption and offers opportunities for 22nd Century to provide unique and significant competitive advantages to commercial partners. The addition of hops, a critical input for the $500 billion global brewing industry as well as a growing source of medically-important molecules, expands our total addressable markets to an estimated $1.3 trillion.”\n\n95% of all hops are used to make beer. The rising demand for microbrew and craft beers is driving the specialty hops market where distinctive flavors, aromas and nutritional uses are important in creating unique and differentiated products. The XXII R&amp;amp;D program objectives include creating new proprietary hop plants and valuable IP using their know-how and technologies, utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other non-GMO technology.\n\nXXII is establishing a new subsidiary in the Netherlands, 22nd Century Group Europe B.V., to open new revenue opportunities in hops, as well as serve their tobacco and hemp/cannabis plant franchises through an expanded global footprint.\n\nXXII is on the move now with a move toward globalization and a new product pipeline that may generate revenues quickly. The demand for proprietary, specialized, non-GMO hops is high and XXII has the tools to provide them.\n\n7/23/2021 Cowen Initiated Coverage Outperform $5.00\n\n**On the tobacco front**, earlier in August, the company announced that they were highly confident their MRTP (modified risk tobacco products) application has completed the FDA’s scientific review process and is now in the documentation process, the final stage before the FDA announces its decision. While the company’s VLN cigarettes were approved for sale in 2019, this important designation will allow 22nd Century to communicate key features of VLN® King and VLN® Menthol King, including the headline claim of “95% less nicotine.” VLN® tastes, smells, and smokes like a conventional cigarette. Both the FDA and the Biden administration have been looking for ways to curb illness, and consequently healthcare expenses, associated with cigarette smoking.\n\n**On the cannabis front**, XXII has been building its network of partnerships to maximize the upstream segment of the cannabinoid value chain since 2019. Components of 22nd Century’s proprietary value chain include: plant profiling tailored to the needs of customers (CannaMetrix), genetics to deliver differentiated traits to maximize yield of a specific cannabinoid or deliver a certain taste or fragrance profile (KeyGene), and commercial-scale plant breeding and cultivation of disruptive plant lines as well as year-round ingredient extraction/purification (Extractas Bioscience, Sawatch Agriculture, Folium Botanical, Aurora Cannabis, Needle Rock Farms, and Panacea).\n\nThe XXII “trifecta” of market sectors it participates in is now complete with tobacco, cannabis, and hops. As CEO Mish pointed out above, these three sectors address an **estimated market of $1.3T**. Sometimes we get lost with those numbers but each **1% of a $1.3T market potential is $13B**.\n\nStay tuned for more coverage on 22nd Century Group coming very soon.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 22nd Century Group, Inc.22nd Century Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: XXII) is a leading plant biotechnology and intellectual property company focused on improving health and wellness through plant science. 22nd Century uses modern plant breeding technologies, gene-editing, and molecular breeding to deliver value to its customers in the life science and consumer products industries by creating new, proprietary tobacco, hemp/cannabis and hop plants with optimized alkaloid and flavonoid profiles as well as improved yields and valuable agronomic traits. 22nd Century was founded to build intellectual property related to nicotine biosynthesis in the tobacco plant and to commercialize its proprietary reduced nicotine content (RNC) tobacco plants, which have become the cornerstone of FDA’s comprehensive plan to address the enormous amount of death and disease caused by addiction to smoking. **The Company has also begun to leverage its plant science expertise and existing partnerships to create and commercialize new, proprietary hemp/cannabis and hop plants to optimize their genetics and create valuable new intellectual property.**\n\n[Privacy policy and disclaimer](https://mailchi.mp/tradersnewssource/exciting-report-in-a-hot-sector-coming-tomorrow-649728?e=[UNIQID])</td>

      <td>Okay you guys and gals, I'm back. Yes this has been a bloodbath. No getting around that.\n\nIn order for a squeeze to happen it requires 2 things: Public Interest &amp;amp; Share Buying. \n\nInvestors often make the mistake of going "well X factors and Y factors have happened so long as you've done the DD remain Bullish." The problem is that the general public are NOT investors and have no idea, nor are even aware of x or y factors. Those things simply have no affect on them. The general public is ONLY aware of hype. They have to see it enough, they have to hear it enough, they have to be shown proof that it's going...UP. That's right. While DD will keep investors happy to buy as the share price drops, a downward trend will scare off the general public. They only buy when things are going up. The stock has taken a beating and everyday has dripped down slowly but surely. That tells me that bulls are doing their best to hold on but even they are losing conviction by the hour. Thus the slow decline down. This stock needs a fresh new injection of public interest in order to spike up the price. Just the truth. Bulls have either spent all they can, or exited without plan to return in the near future. **The idea now is to flood YouTube Twitter Facebook etc with DD on $SPRT and well detailed explanations of WHY the si% increase is bullish- with examples and data given.** Target accounts with large followings, especially those related to energy/tech/crypto, because that's how you will reach the largest audiences possible. Tons of YouTube videos etc. That newfound sentiment has to be garnered. Write articles and publish them so people searching up the stock come across them. Things like that. Strategic planning. Just the truth. Eventually news will pick it up and wonder why so many articles have been written, why it's being discussed all over social media, etc. $GME at the beginning of the year had dedicated Bulls that ensured the public interest was extremely high. \n\nNext up is Share Buying. The concept is simple enough. Buy shares. Again Bulls are mostly spent. So this plays in tandem with the Public Interest support. Buying otm options at this point is a waste of money until this begins to trend upwards. \n\nWe have a long weekend coming up, monday is labor day. Every Friday the past month, the stock has spiked. It will happen again this Friday. Shorts generally do not like holding ver the weekend. They certainly will not want to hold over the long weekend. What am I saying? The best plan of action is to flood the internet and garner as much public interest on $SPRT by Friday. This will invoke a massive share buying process, forcing shorts to cover a higher si than before- with a lower float than before. Again the long weekend is coming up. If you read this, and are bullish, give at least one of those things a try. At the very least spread the general message as much as possible. Not just on reddit but across social media platforms. Again, the general public is the audience.</td>

      <td>I have just done a cursory overview of BGFV (Big 5) stock and it seems like free money. Full disclosure: I'm loading up on some September and December calls, but this isn't just to shill. What the hell is going on with this stock to keep it down so low? \n\n**NOTE:** I wrote this up last night and they popped this AM. Some ratios or numbers might not reflect the run from this morning. \n\nReasons I see it exploding:\n\n* **A P/E under 5 (FIVE!)** that is NOT due to some one off income recognition. They are doing this      while talking at length on the earnings call about supply chain issues holding them back. EPS looks sustainable to me.\n* **Healthy balance sheet**. NO DEBT. $118 million in cash meaning market cap less cash is only \~$400 million or \~4x earnings.\n* **Growth has not reverted since reopening**: same store sales are way up over both 2020 and 2019      for pre-pandemic comps. They are trickling in a few new stores this year, but only have a footprint in a few states, so there is big expansion room if they choose to deploy their huge cash surplus to fund it. \n* **They print cash**: Free cash flow in the next year is looking like something around $200 million per year based on the last few quarters and Q3 guidance. At current prices, they could literally buy back 30% of their float PER YEAR and not take out any debt to do it. \n* **They upped their dividend to 4%, but that is still barely makes a dent in use of their cash flow**. Last quarter they gave a special dividend of $1 per share ($20 million total) and STILL built up almost $20 million in cash. They have so much money coming in that they don't know what to do with it, so are just cutting checks to shareholders. \n* **They are shorted in to oblivion - but the short attack      looks to be over.** Maybe      this is why the price is as low as it is? At last report they had almost 8      million shares shorted or 40% of float, a jump of 3.5 million shares in      just the last 6 weeks. The fee on renting shares is up to 10-15% in the      last week, so the supply of shares available to borrow to short seems to      have dried up. Whoever blinks first and closes out a large position may      just be the start of a quick turnaround. \n* **Institutions buying up in bulk** \- Fintel shows 16 million owned by tutes, other resources say \~10.5 million. Either way, that is a healthy cut of float and it is GROWING QUICKLY. The filings that have landed in August so far show $62 million in net inflows in Q2 (over 3 million shares worth). Most      of the shares are in big 401k type funds or index funds. They are not in for the short term. Remember those 8 million shorts hanging around out there? The supply of moving shares to close those positions is drying up quickly. I'm not it in for a squeeze, but the ingredients are all there.\n\nI challenge you to come up with one sound reason (other than an irrational market) for why this stock should one of the best buys on the market.</td>

      <td>Decisions, decisions…. We all make decisions in life, from what we will wear in the morning, what we will eat today and who we will marry. It is wild that some of these decisions especially who we will marry may take months, or even years to decide…..and yet when it comes to YOLO on a stock/option with 10-20,000 or even a life savings that some of us will just pull the trigger without any DD. Yes, SPRT did go from under 10 Monday to 60 Friday, but how many of us are going to catch that at the right time? Everyone wants the next SPRT…. There does seem to be a short squeeze a play on BBIG, ATER, ROOT but be careful! I get asked this quite a lot especially this week after SPRT. There are people saying they want to bet big!\n\nI am not saying do not buy the stock/option I am saying maybe we should do some research or place small bets. I too, in this market are playing them more often, however I am using 1-2% of my account to trade them. It can turn your 10,000 into 50,000 in a week, but how will you feel if you have 5,000? I can name 10 grenades past 2 weeks that shot up to the moon and did a crash landing on earth. So please be careful in what we decide.\n\nI still trade a lot of defensive plays but I am mixing in some of these grenades… I am willing to take a loss on them if I must. I have 2 grenades PMCB, NOAV that I am down slightly on.. No options. \n\nAlso, it is important not to convince ourselves that this is a fundamental move. Yes, their could be actual news, and usually actually news starts a rise, however this market is extreme, buyers/sellers pile on more than ever on good and bad news.. This doesn’t mean your stock now has the cure for covid, cancer, is going to win a huge contract.\n\nI would say to have an idea of the profit you have in mind 10-20% and take some off the table when you are up, because you don’t want to be a bag holder when the cure for cancer fails.\n\nGood luck everyone.</td>

      <td>Recently I started a trading strategy around earnings releases. These periods tend to experience movements and volatility that can make for good opportunities in options trading. These types of trades are also riskier than other periods because of a lot of factors playing against you, like time decay and especially the IV crush that happens after the release, making most bought options worthless by itself.\n\nLike most things, the market prices-in the expected volatility and movements of the stock prices around earnings. By studying iv and other factors, one can actually estimate this market expectation.\n\nUsually traders prefer to be on the sell side of options before earnings to take advantage of the iv crush and a stock price movement that stays within the market expectation. However, a lot of stocks end up beating this expected move for a multitude of reasons: way better or worse results ending in investors adjusting their positions, but also a detail in the report or guidance can shift expectations, and anyway the stock ends up moving more than expected move. This make for very profitable options trades when we are on the buy side and we actually hold through earnings. The goal here is to spot these companies.\n\nIdea\n\nThe main idea of the approach here is to let the data speak for itself. The end goal is to build a classification model that “spots” companies likely to beat market expectation, First we need to define that expectation. A first approximation can be to consider the average of the historic moves and add some offset as a multiplier of its standard variation. If we are able to predict if a company is likely to move higher than what it used to do it can be a first clue to look deeper and assess options opportunities.\n\nFeatures\n\nSince I’m not aiming at predicting a particular direction of movement, I will be mostly using features that reflect the market behaviour around earnings for every stock. I will use 3 categories of features:\n\n\- **Company related**Sector of activity, market cap, size of shareholders, time since ipo, ..\n\n\- **Earnings related**I am looking at the behaviour of the stock price, stock volume and options values around earnings. For every company, I calculated the movement occurring in each indicator every day the week of the earnings, and record the maximum in absolute value. The learning set needs to have historic occurrences so we can use the actual values of these indicators to make predictions. An example of these features looks like this for TSLA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fq6c31nllbk71.png?width=1350&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2e82f6181163e6fef327f4a4dc1b15efde5c5f07\n\n\- **News related**The goal here is to let the model know how news coverage may help predict a big movement around earnings that would beat the market expectation. We need an indicator of this coverage, so we will use the number of articles as well as a sentiment score. I scrapped all pages of [investorshub.](https://investorshub.advfn.com/)com every day and classified articles by date and stock concerned with the news. I then run Vader algorithm for news sentiment extraction so we can obtain a score by day reflecting how positive or negative the news was. I then record the average positive and negative score for the last 30 days before each earnings date. Here is a sample :\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2jqr95aolbk71.png?width=1342&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=31e7a7286b6c5d1eb4eff571c36d7d3f6d656d79\n\n# Target\n\nNow that we have all these indicators going back to 2015, we can add the target we will be looking for. We are interested in an actual stock move that outperforms the expected one, that we define it to be the average of historic move. For each date, we can then average the previous movements and set our classification to target to either 1 if the actual absolute move is higher than the average at that point and 0 otherwise.\n\nWe end up with a dataset of +300k releases and approximately 30% of the observations have a positive target.\n\n# Model\n\nThe next step is to actually train our machine learning model and study the results. A lot of important data-science steps are involved that I will not dive into, for example we need our model to not overfit and actually be able to compare the results versus a random model and use a score metric that actually makes sense. The model used here is [xgboost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost), as it is a natural extension of an intuitive model that we an actually interpret (I will write up a dedicated article about all this).\n\nWe obtain a decent performance over all stocks of around 60%, with some having very high predictability by our model which is what we aim for. Here is a graph of the distribution of the model scores across all stocks. The score used is the [roc score.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xo5l7vuqlbk71.png?width=1342&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a4122088f95c07da1cdfd2df907096636c954388\n\n# Results\n\nTo backtest our approach, we can look at how our model behaved on previous predictions and compare them with actual outcomes. This should be coherent with the scores and results obtained above if the preprocessing and processing we did was correct.\n\nLooking at the last two months, we can calculate the difference between the actual move and the target the model predicted the stock would beat, we see that when filtering for stocks with probability &amp;gt; 60% and a general roc score higher than 55%, the realised performance is actually a bit higher than the expected 60% (which makes sense since we’re keeping only high predictions and those the model is most confident about):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/avwwlsfwlbk71.png?width=1392&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9afc01e995e8ce4fc3b9df0dfeaba1f5591028f0\n\nThis model is behind the data and recommendations of [earnings-watcher.tech](http://earnings-watcher.tech/) where you can browse into what was discussed here.\n\nI use the platform to calibrate for my options trades around earnings for the high risk / high reward positions like discussed in the beginning. I wrote [this articl](https://medium.com/@EarningsWatcher/picking-options-for-risky-earnings-trades-2d49dcb847e)e about that process.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6vsfc4f0mbk71.png?width=3360&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3508ad717cd41df37dfb9293bffc8b01a0bc56f8\n\nHope you enjoy and let me know what you think!</td>

Lastly a look at current and Historical DCF figures helps me see how the market has and is valuing the company compared to it's fair value based on fundamentals.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t65qp2w9pak71.png?width=1564&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c953858d055c804a6bca950fd28df6697ead95a3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/udxky1w9pak71.png?width=1558&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b290d2740131854de0e657a09082c6c8f4ed1480\n\n# Fundamental Analysis\n\nThis is the most important part of my process. Now that I have looked at the various financial data I like to put it all together to see how it all fits together as well as seeing YoY or QoQ growth. By combining my favorite or go-to data points I can often find patterns or at least make connections that may support or go against my thesis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uv8p7xaapak71.png?width=1558&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b8b7940b020e9df9992c62efaa5081278fdfd5ff\n\n# Documents\n\nReading through SEC filings (10K's, 10Q's, Proxies, Prospectuses etc) as well as Earning Call Transcripts are essential parts of my process. So much amazing information can be found in these filings. It takes a little patience but it's most definitely worth doing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7mqnbwoapak71.png?width=1560&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4946e035eac5e54a4f2a1e0bdbfcd530b47fbef9\n\n# Ownership\n\nIt's always good to know which Funds and Institutions own the company you're looking at. When did they buy share? How many? At what Price?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wtiu584bpak71.png?width=1548&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=af3bfbd81dd8b6bdd2ba8a04e33484ee8903f740\n\n# Price Charts\n\nI look at price charts to find any large fluctuation in price. I then find out when the large moves happened and go back looking for articles, press releases, social media posts to try and understand what caused them. This helps me understand what has historically effected the price of a company so that as I track and monitor it I can hopefully spot things in advance.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2rmdy5hbpak71.png?width=1563&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e1baa84a06cb4318249951b336d7a90d22f32baa</td>

      <td>This market more than ever is irrational. I have been trading since late 1994 and have been thru the dot com crash.. Greenspan's "Irrational Exuberance", 9/11 when the market was shut down for days, 2008 crash and last year's covid.. I swear I have never seen anything even close to this!\n\nBack in the late 90s and even when the Nasdaq crashed in March of 2000, you would have a handful of stocks down 10-20% in a single day. You may have a handful of stocks with volume over 10 million.. Check the history! Now you have stocks up 200% and down the next day 50% I cant mention the ticker here or I will get banned. But there are many stocks that go down 15-20% on nothing! SLQT went down 50% on a slight miss Thursday!   \n\n\nI feel now more than ever there are gamblers everywhere. Everyone piles on on positive or negative news quickly...because of social media.. We know.....\n\nSo my question is, has it changed the way you trade/invest and how?   \n\n\nFor myself I am quickly adapting........ I am actually trading more momentum stocks than I ever traded before.. Companies with horrible financials... which is hard for me, but we have to adapt or get killed on SLQT??\n\nPlease share ideas, I am trying to adapt as quickly as possible too!</td>

      <td>I wanted to share with you a typical analysis I do on stocks in preparation of trades around their earnings, and we're looking into the crow's favourite $AMC!\n\nThe goal here is to bet on tail events happening around earnings. Like most things, the market expects a certain movement of the stock price that is priced in in the options plays. Buying strangles or straddles with closest expirations the day before release is a very risky trade as iv crush and time decay are against us, but if higher move than expected occur, they are huge money printers and that's what we aim at. I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarningsWatcher/comments/p2hbw4/picking_options_for_risky_earnings_plays/) post about these plays if you're interested.\n\nFirst I like to start by looking at the [price chart with earnings dates highlighted](https://earnings-watcher.tech/#/company?symbol=AMC), just to get a sense of the general movement of the stocks around releases and overall.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z22c2ffgbyj71.png?width=3026&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=662db7026091d104c20180ff716dcf3a3c6bb831\n\nIt looks like the market is pretty reactive around earnings for AMC. Let's confirm that by looking at historic numbers. This is a summary of [stock movements for the last 5 releases:](https://earnings-watcher.tech/#/company?symbol=GME)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v8fze6ofbyj71.png?width=1460&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=41c26e68ed18abd6b0ee67ee740365fb563cc9cd\n\nFor each release, we see the actual movement that happened, compared to the average historic move and standard deviation (a metric of dispersion basically) computed then. The average historic move is usually a good approximation of the movement expected by the market, and we want to know if AMC usually beats this expectation. We can see that AMC consistently has beaten its average move, except for one release, with more than 20% move the week of earnings last year.\n\nCurrently, the market expectation of movements based on all historic moves is around 12.1% with a standard deviation of 5.7%. This means that the stock usually moves in a window of 0 to 14% most of the time, and any movement higher than that would be the market expectation.\n\nNow the goal is to see how likely is AMC to beat that 14% threshold for our options to be profitable.\n\n[earnings-watcher.tech](https://earnings-watcher.tech/) developed a machine learning model that uses features from historic movements in stocks, volume, news coverage etc to predict if a stock is likely to move higher than the expectations. This basically tries to detect patterns that are relevant in predicting these movements. Let's see what they have in store for AMC\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hdsv3vpdbyj71.png?width=1152&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=850fca21713eb23081271e88d6a39be0703315c8\n\nThe model is giving a high probability of big movement 82%, but is not really confident on predictions made on AMC previously as we see in the model score 50% (the score here is ROC score for classification, taking into account the rarity of the events we look for). How did it find that ? This is the pattern the model identified:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/718uv2adbyj71.png?width=2912&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4bfecad96a9a5f5274fd02467c8f2f4ffd7fb70b\n\nThe model found that companies with an average movement and std dev. of around 5%, combined with market cap and the fact the median move of the last three earnings is around 30%, usually beat expectations. This pattern is statistically significant, meaning that any other variation of these features would not help predict a big movement, and the model was able to isolate this pattern. \n\nWe can also take a look at previous patterns the model found in predicting AMC earnings move:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7imo69zabyj71.png?width=2832&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9da90582a8152751e8db94f024f69d45cd05706f\n\nFor example, back in 2018-11-08, the model identified a pattern based on average historic move being around 11%, market expectation a bit lower at 10% and especially a price variation of +20% during last earnings. This pattern occurred 7 other times and had an accuracy of 71%, meaning that one third of stocks showing this pattern during their earnings ended up beating market expectations.\n\nWe can finally take a look at the [strangles and straddles prices](https://earnings-watcher.tech/#/company?symbol=GME) for AMC\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/61r28sbabyj71.png?width=2758&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=39fe57478457d01dffa689246b47600a082164e6\n\nThe minimum break even is around 60% (with very high volatility), meaning for these options to be profitable, there needs to be approximately a 60% move, which is close to the market expectation the model was aiming at. This calculation is very conservative as it only takes into account the options intrinsic value at expiration!\n\nWell, AMC is not the perfect stock for a machine learning model to sport opportunity as it has all of reddit backing it up but at least you use how we can use this!\n\nEnjoy and let me know what you think!</td>

      <td>Hi everyone,\n\nThis is a follow up on posts of about some statistics and a machine learning model trained to spot big movements around earnings.\n\nThe goal here is to bet on tail events happening around earnings. Like most things, the market expects a certain movement of the stock price that is priced in in the options plays. I was interested in stocks with a heavy tail that can move more than this threshold to make strangles plays very profitable (but very risky if no tail). I compiled historic data of price and iv movements around releases, and trained an ML model to detect stocks likely to beat the market expectation, that i approximate to be the average of historic movements. This gives me a list of stocks that I then study to pick my risky option plays.\n\nLast week, the model recommend $NFH and $PNBK ([this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarningsWatcher/comments/p8kgsl/stocks_most_likely_to_beat_market_expectation_of/) post) that ended up moving 1.1% and 4.2% respectively. I will be sharing the results here every week as usual.

      <td>Small cap Biotechs are risky (but reward is related to risk) and have high volatility ( beta) but can reward with nice  returns from a TRADING standpoint- hence one has to watch the share price frequently and take profits as soon as they spike on good news ( as my recommendation to take profits on Wed after hours on AMRX ). I have been trading in these for last couple of years and the school of hard knocks combined with nice profits has let me conclude that one must have a combo of 3 to 5 to protect against risk. At this point my three favorites which have all corrected, then completed a consolidation and IMHO (and I could be 100pct wrong ! on one or more of them) are $EVAX $GTBP $CLLS with equal amounts .\n\nYou need to do your own evaluation and establish your own buy points. Ofcourse trying to be smart and cherry pick one is more a gamble than a trading strategy and money is better spent on a weekend trip to Vegas.\n\nPS: For the more conservative and long term holders the two blue chips paying nice dividends and can also be put in an IRA account are $PFE, $GILD</td>

Building the reach of its core app will likely take near-term priority over earnings growth, but that makes sense at this stage, and expanding its user base and experimenting with ways to increase average user spending could put the business in a position to become a cash machine. \n\nWith a market capitalization of roughly $5.7 billion, the online dating market looks poised for strong growth through the next decade and beyond, and the company could deliver fantastic returns for shareholders if it continues to capture a substantial portion of the market.

I WILL NOT ask you to increase your positions, rather I'll challenge you all to increase AWARENESS of $SPRT/Greenidge Generations. \n\n[Reputable Stock Analysts on $SPRT](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/21/08/22617157/could-support-com-get-squeezed-to-the-moon)\n\nWe are literally on the brink of the best spike/squeeze play this half of the year. That's a fact. Let's raise awareness to as many as possible in a strategic manner I call "common sense." Literally cannot go tits up SHOULD we all put forth effort in doing so. I know a very influential being who spends time on social media platforms posting memes and bragging about shitcoins- *JUST for the hell of it*. **ELON MUSK.** Coca-Cola uses the Super Bowl for ads because it reaches the largest audience possible. They aren't telling anyone to buy their products, they're merely leveraging visibility. Papa Johns, etc. Those of you that either took a marketing course or have common sense, can understand where I'm going with this; as well as why. **ELON MUSK is our Super Bowl.** His twitter account is ripe with a large audience always maintaining eyes on it- and even better it's the "tech/future/green energy" crowd. There is NOT a better set up than the opportunity laid bare before us. This will work, again should we all put in effort, mainly in two ways:\n\n1. Elon doesn't have to buy, he simply needs to mention/discuss Greenidge Generations/$SPRT. The crowd will take notice, the media will take notice, news stations and institutions will take notice. \n2. Merely by so many people mentioning, questioning &amp;amp; discussing $SPRT on Elon's twitter feeds- it will draw attention. Eventually drawing the man's attention himself. \n\nThis is our golden opportunity. Let's not squander it with petty arguments. The path is laid before all willing to embark on this journey.</td>

      <td>Hey all, I’m just some tech nerd who likes to dabble in investing and "investing." However, there is a company that I’m interacting with that, frankly, I’m surprised hasn’t blown up higher than they are. Figured I’d share it on a much more popular place, because I think it deserves a little love. \n\nAmbarella ($AMBA) is a somewhat small (3.4B market cap as of writing this) semiconductor company that seems to be very focused on creating the best computer vision processors out there. They also make really good, normal application processors that have fantastic video processing capabilities. I've gotten my hands on them a bit, not as much as I would like, but I see some promise in their new stuff and think they're undervalued. \n\n# Competition:\n\nBasically if you think of AI vision processing you probably have the one behemoth in mind: Nvidia. How the hell is this company that's worth 1/200th of Nvidia going to compete? Well it comes down to architecture. Nvidia slams the same design from their top end A series card to their lowest end GPU, designed for hardcore parallel processing like you would expect a GPU to be. This works for sure, but it is inefficient for pure vision processing, compared to a purpose built processor. Ambarella can do stereoscopic vision processing in their highest end processor in a silicon die that's probably at least 5x smaller than Nvidia's highest end processor, at likely significantly less cost too. That's a big deal for both power efficiency, and pure cost. \n\nAMBA is also one of two companies that has an AI vision and video processing API with AWS. I bet you can guess the other one. That's great for developers to get used to the ecosystem, and easy access to new talent that may be able to bring their employer in. \n\nI am unaware of any other company that has nearly the level of ability in their processors for computer vision. With the constant increase of self driving startups out there, I can only imagine that AMBA playing at the top of the field alone will be huge, as not every single company can afford hundreds of millions to design their own silicon, like Tesla did after moving away from NVDA. \n\n# Catalysts:\n\nAMBA is holding their earnings one week from now, August 31st. This will be the first earnings that they are going to have been working with ARVL and KeepTruckin. KeepTruckin handles 90,000 drivers in the US currently, and ARVL has at least 10k sales planned in the future. I’ll let those people talk more about what’s going on there, I’m not up to date with the car manufacturer space and I’m pretty sure that they were a meme stock at some point, so they’ll probably go crazy talking about all their sales that I’m hoping they get. \n\nHaving more customers as a semiconductor company creating products on high end process nodes is *basically free* when you’re running in lower quantities. Why? How? Well it just comes down to the massive non-recurring costs in semiconductor manufacturing. This is something the semiconductor people know well, but I’ll give a rough outline for those of you not in the know. Manufacturing silicon on the most cutting edge nodes is insanely expensive, even if you’re just wanting to produce one single die, you’re spending tens, or hundreds of millions of dollars just to make the patterns to make your chip. For TSMC 7nm it’s likely in the hundred to hundreds of millions of dollars that you have to spend once. Every single wafer you buy gets made with those patterns. Each wafer costs money of course, but each one pales in comparison to the amount you spend in the actual photomasks to make your chips.\n\nIf they end up selling more chips, the NR costs get spread out over more, allowing either more competitive pricing if they want, or just more profit. With what is probably 100k of their top end chip sales public, that's a big deal for AMBA as each of their chips costs probably ~$50 to make, and probably sells for significant multiples of that. They are also definitely selling many more than that in more low-end devices like security cameras and action cameras, but that's not the high end flashy cool tech so I'm not gonna bore everyone with that. \n\n# Future: \n\nThis is more of a "what I see and what I want" kinda section. I'm very much an outsider, and it's very hard to get any word from the company, so everything here should be taken with a grain of salt. \n\nI can definitely see AMBA upping their software friendliness and taking a page out of Nvidia's book and making a Jetson competitor. As I said in the title, they're a very quiet company. I would have never heard about them had I not been working with building software for action cameras. Getting their products and software into the hands of real developers to create products with their chips, regardless of if they sell 100 or 100k would be good for sales directly, and massive for brand recognition. AMBA is competing directly with custom silicon, like what's in Tesla, Waymo in my opinion, and if they can get a good enough product that it's worth these big companies not spending hundreds of millions to make their own silicon and instead just using the CV2 processor or whatever comes next, that's be great. I'm seeing the same thing that happened way back in the 90s with companies that had their own custom processors just moving to Intel or AMD because it just didn't make sense to spend the money designing and building their own processor when they could just use someone else's. If AMBA could become the Intel or AMD of computer vision, that's be pretty huge. \n\n## Position and plan\n\nWhat am I planning on doing? Well, hodling my 100 shares. I’m no rich man, and frankly although I think this earnings will be fantastic, good news isn’t always correlated with good stock price. So dumb shares it is, no options or anything.</td>

      <td>Good day everyone,\n\nWe are initiating coverage on **Siyata Mobile Inc. (NASDAQ: SYTA),** a Business-to-Business (B2B) global vendor of next generation Push-To-Talk over Cellular (PoC) devices and cellular booster systems.\n\nCurrent price     $4.89/share (at market close 8-20-21)\n\nSYTA is a provider of state-of-the-art communication devices and cellular boosting systems primarily for first responders. We’ll talk more about that below but first we want to discuss why SYTA shares indicate potential for a near term swing.\n\nWe’ve been watching this company for a while and feel like the time is right to report on them because:\n\nWe see some potential near-term catalysts as revenues improve and new products hit the market.\n\nShares are trading significantly off recent highs ($9.52 on July 1st, $12.69 on April 13th)\n\nChart pattern set up for a swing.\n\n2/8/2021            Maxim Group Initiated Coverage   Buy    **Target $17.00**\n\nWhen we look at the [SYTA stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=SYTA) we note a few things. The shares are trading below their 50 DMA of $7.18 and below their 200 DMA of $8.98. The RSI (14) is 28.21. These data indicate the shares could be oversold.\n\nOn July 2, 2021, the company released its FYE 2020 financial results, and they may have been disappointing to investors as revenues overseas dropped and impacted overall performance. The slide in the company share price has continued since then.\n\nThe financial data released on July 2nd had some silver linings that may have overlooked. For the year end 2020, North American sales increased. Also on July 2, 2021, the company released financial data for Q1 2021 reflecting the following:\n\n**Revenue was up 77% from Q1 2020 to $4M**, indicating a potential pro forma revenue level of $16M for FYE 2021. At the current market value of $23.5M the price to sales ratio would be a low 1.45X.\n\nGross margin increased to 43.2%, an enviable level of gross margin for any company.\n\nSYTA had $9.7M in cash on March 31, 2021. The company has a small share structure with 4.82M outstanding shares and **4.64M in float (est.)**\n\nFirst responders have traditionally used Land Mobile two-way radios (LMR) and there has been a need for next generation communication. That next gen system is known as Push-to-Talk over Cellular (PoC). SYTA develops and manufactures under the Siyata brand name and licenses the Uniden® brand name for its UV350 in-vehicle device, its cellular signal boosters.\n\nAccording to a recent [press release issued by SYTA](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rugged-handset-could-game-changer-235616389.html), “After 9/11, the U.S. government recognized the need for a unified nationwide first-responder network and allocated $100 billion to create FirstNet, a broadband 4G LTE network in the U.S. that is operated by AT&amp;amp;T. (NYSE: T) The network recently reported that it currently provides 2.5 million connections (vs 2.2 million reported at the end of Q1 2021) to 17,000 public safety agencies (vs 16,000 reported at the end of Q1 2021), and Siyata is tapping into that network”.\n\n**Product line up:**\n\n**The UV350**, the Company’s flagship device and the only dedicated in-vehicle device on the market that has been certified as FirstNet Ready™. The UV350 runs on the Android operating system and comes with noise cancellation, a WiFi hotspot, available accessories like a PTT (Push-To-Talk) palm mic, and 4G LTE high-speed data of up to 150 Mbps. It's received numerous government and industry certifications, including FCC, PTCRB, GMS, and IC.\n\n**Handset: SD7** Siyata will be launching its newest rugged handset, the SD7 (pictured below), in North America later this year. Siyata has been designing and selling rugged handsets for years in international markets, but this will be its first model in North America. It’s a Push-To-Talk device with a limited interface that is LTE, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth-enabled and uses the Android operating system.\n\n**Cellular Boosters.** Siyata’s boosters (also marketed as Uniden®) are differentiated from the competition for wireless carrier connectivity, smartphone selection, and RF passive bypass technology. The RF bypass technology was created by ClearRF, a recent acquisition of Siyata that manufactures its devices in the U.S. in an ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) facility that is also AS9100D-certified to work with aviation, space, and defense companies.\n\nTo date, Siyata has sold its UV350 devices to fleets in Israel, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States. The North American market for its three products is estimated at $50M. The company anticipate its near-term revenue growth to be in North America as it transitions its products from 3G to 4G.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\nIndications of significant revenue gains in 2021.  \nState-of-the-art communications vendor for first responders.  \nTiny share structure with low 4.6M float.  \nSustained price dip ready to turn upward.\n\nStay tuned for more information on SYTA.\n\nLucky\n\n[Privacy Policy and Disclaimer](https://mailchi.mp/tradersnewssource/nasdaq-company-on-the-verge-of-a-growth-spurt-649700?e=[UNIQID])</td>

Tembo e-LV is cumulating $400m+ in 3 deal with distributors in Canada, Australia and Scandinavia.  \n \n2. Tembo e-LV has a Letter of intent with Toyota Australia. [In this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJFqF12drYM&amp;amp;t=170s) they announce that we could see a Master Service Agreement in 60 days starting June 24th.  \n \n3. Market cap of 115m as of august 1st.  \n \n4. Small float, 17m outstanding shares with 50% of insider ownership. Arowana holdings which is led by the same CEO owns over 7m shares as of august 2021.  \n \n5. Analyst price target of 19$ based on [a DCF model](https://www.edisongroup.com/publication/ev-platform-for-growth/29178/)[ with assumptions of 5,000 EVs in 2025 (every change of 1,000 vehicles has an impact of c $5 a share on their valuation). ](https://www.edisongroup.com/publication/ev-platform-for-growth/29178/)  \n \n6. Complementarity between their three subsidiaries, offering turn-key solutions for decarbonization of manufacturing and industrial processes (all-in-one, solar, batteries and EVs).  \n\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bear case**  \n\n\n1. Never been profitable since inception.  \n \n2. High risks of failing execution on the EV segment.  \n \n3. Cost of sale is high. Currently gross profit is at 16%, [projected margins by analyst](https://www.edisongroup.com/publication/ev-platform-for-growth/29178/) for Tembo are 13%.  \n \n4. Competition is starting to get tougher, what once was the hedge of Tembo products is now becoming mainstream. With Ford announcing an all-electric F-150 and Tesla with their Cybertruck, the pick up segment should get more players in the next 2-3 years.  \n \n5. Shareholders on social media platforms will agree with the affirmation that holding VVPR is a frustrating effort.  \n \n6. The US solar portfolio have seen major drawbacks, with over 600MWdc cancelled or stalled.  \n \n7. Cost and scarcity of raw materials for battery and solar arrays systems might be detrimental to the cost of goods.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xty3dtddj0j71.png?width=562&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=391474fd1925e629736ef18cda2e9cd887e4561d\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm personally holding a huge position relative to my portfolio I strongly believe that the cheap it gets the more of a buy it becomes since its already trading at a discount if you factor the new EV vertical</td>

      <td>Good evening everyone and thank you so much for taking a time out to read my post. I wanted to shine a little light on Gohealth symbol GOCO. They operate an online health marketplace. They are actually one of the leaders in this field. The growth online to do insurance has been extraordinary as seen with the company’s growth. This past quarter sales were up 55% year over year. I have traded GOCO by the way around 10-11 in the past. I still believe the stock is worth 11-12 but at the moment the negative sentiment will over take everything. This market unlike no other wants instant gratification, so you have extreme movements up and down. Let us first look at some highlights from the report.\n\n· Second quarter 2021 net revenue of $196.9 million increased 55% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 net revenue of $401.1 million increased 50% compared to the prior year period.\n\n· Second quarter 2021 Medicare—Internal revenue of $160.4 million increased 84% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 Medicare—Internal revenue of $317.8 million increased 74% compared to the prior year period.\n\n· Second quarter 2021 Medicare Advantage ("MA") Approved Submissions of 152,749 increased 58% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 MA Approved Submissions of 323,876 increased 52% compared to the prior year period.\n\n· Second quarter 2021 MA LTV Per Approved Submission of $953 increased 5% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 MA LTV Per Approved Submission of $975 increased 11% compared to the prior year period.\n\n· Second quarter 2021 net loss of $39.2 million compared to a net loss of $22.9 million in the prior year period; Adjusted EBITDA1 of $14.3 million decreased 47% compared to the prior year period due to the 2021 strategic investments in agent capacity, marketplace technology, branding and the Encompass Platform. YTD 2021 net loss was $46.4 million compared to a net loss of $23.8 million in the prior year period; Adjusted EBITDA1 of $46.4 million decreased 25% compared to the prior year period.\n\n· The Company tightened its full year 2021 revenue outlook to $1,200 - $1,300 million (+37% to +48%) powered by commission net revenue of $1,000 - $1,100 million (+49% to +64%) as agent growth is tracking at the high end of expectations. The Company lowered its Adjusted EBITDA1 outlook to $300 - $330 million (+11% to +22%), primarily due to higher agent costs expected in 2021.\n\nNow, because of the losses and as the CEO has said most of this cost is going to be attributed to the cost of labor, as they have retained more staff and increased bonuses to retain customers, this indeed will be a strike on margins, however one must ask themselves since growth is there and there was a slight miss\n\nBottom line if this drop was warranted.\n\nAlso note the CEO who gets stock options/warrants for free, did not want to wait for options that may take 3-6 months to exercise he went into the market and bought 1.5 million worth of shares. 253,000 shares @ 4.68.. The initial reaction the next day could be expected. It ran to 5.41, I do not know how it fell back Friday. So you are aware the CEO is not a billionaire. He gets a 325,000 salary and with his bonuses and options he gets about 4 million per year. Clint has been at GOCO since 2001!\n\nAlso please note the form 4s, other insiders are buying since the drop, also around the same price. They are buying because they do not believe the stock can be bought cheaper than this, otherwise they would wait for options and warrants! The strongest conviction for me is when insiders buy. A company can announce a buyback, and that is fine and dandy, that is cash the company makes, but when 3-10 board members buy at the open market and use their own cash!!!??? I love it! \n\nI will also be the first to say that earnings report was not good, however it was slightly bad, wasn’t absolutely atrocious. A 60% drop is as if the company is going out of business. So you have to ask yourself in 3 – 6 months if the company keeps growing sales and they said they will have 1.2-1..3 billion in sales for the year, should drop this much? Please share thoughts and ideas..</td>

      <td>GoHealth - GOCO down 65% since the last earnings report, were things that bad? Topline sales growth 55% to sales of 197 Million beating 175 Estimate, lost 39 million missing 12 cent loss, missing by 8 cents or 24 million, does that justify a 2 billion market cap loss? CEO used hard cash at 4.68</td>
