      <td>Good morning everyone and thank you for taking the time to read my post. Happy Sunday and I hope you all are enjoying this longer weekend. I think this is a very important topic because it will put the minds of every trader together to come out with 5 tickers or at least 3 that have been winners for you this year. This way people that have been negative now, or all year can have an idea of what they can do, or need to do in order to turn the ship around.\n\nWe all have different strategies. I for one am a day trader so my 5 will be extremely different from a long term holder or swing trader. Do to the fact that I am a day trader. I will also list 5 stocks that I unfortunately allowed to go parabolic on me, but indeed I did trade them when they were far cheaper. For myself, I have something called “Plays” this is a special watch list of tickers that I am ready to trade now, that I feel safe, and I select my symbols off of this list. This list is well over 100 tickers. When a stock has gone up far to much, I no longer feel safe about it and do not trade it at all!\n\nPlease try and be honest with ourselves and do not just try and pick the best gainers because this practice is for everyone to watch a new symbol or have an idea of how you played it to be a success. Thank you, share thoughts and please help one another:\n\nMy 5 as a Day Trader:\n\nRKT – This stock is about 17 dollars, however I have traded this symbol so much that I have probably about 30 dollars in profits. I have traded this all year and even last year as well for 25 cents to a dollar\n\nUWMC – This is in the same sector as RKT, it stands at just 7.50 but I have traded this for probably close to 20 dollars, for many months I traded this 15-50 cents\n\nTIGR – This is about 13 dollars, I have traded this all year this year and also last year as well, I have probably 30+ dollars in profits on this one (25-75 cents a trade)\n\nCPNG – I know this stock is near a 52 week low (I actually have shares at 30.25) but I have traded in and out of this since IPO and have garnered about 50 in profits! (30 cents to 1.25)\n\nCRSR – I have traded this all year as well, no current position. I traded this as high as 40 and have easily made about 40 on this. (25 cents to 1.50)\n\nThese are 5 that I owned and traded often but they just took off and I could not find myself trading them anymore\n\nBILL – This has gone insane, I traded this until about 100… I am actually very negative at these prices, yes, I missed out, but I made a lot on it\n\nMRNA – I know, I know, but when I was trading this, It was still a bio pharma with no vaccine yet! I actually traded this as low as 30 and stopped at 100…\n\nSE – I absolutely loved this company and traded it as low as 30-40 all the way to 150 and said to myself this is crazy! Look at it now, jesus\n\nCMG – OK, I did not trade this within 52 weeks but last March this dipped to 500! I was trading it all the way thru 750. Small blocks of 250 shares… What the heck are they selling EVs in the back? Mining Crypto in the basement????\n\nZM- Boy when covid first hit I was destroying it on this from mid 60s all the way until 150!\n\nI hope this helps others get an idea and thank you everyone.</td>

      <td>Good evening everyone and thank you for taking your time to read the post. I am sorry but we all must take some losses, though none of us like to, and many of us fail to admit we have losses. I figured a post like this can help one another, or can give us ideas on when to take a loss, why and how.\n\nEveryone has a different plan, agenda and goals. So please do share or also give me some ideas, so maybe it will help my repertoire. For myself, taking a loss on a stock has nothing to do with the stock price and has everything to do with actual performance of a company. Yes, it does suck to be down on a stock, but I will not panic sell a stock, when the company is doing amazing. I usually give a company 1 earnings report if there was a slight miss or the report was okay, to see if the company can come back, and the stock can hopefully rally. If the report was very bad, to me that signals a possible turn around or a 6-12 month wait. If the report is bad I will cut my losses and move on.\n\nIt is usually the case after a bad report, an analyst doesn’t want to seem so wrong and they immediately come in and down grade a stock bringing further negative sentiment. This negative sentiment can last very long. A good example is RAD, it took 10 weeks and I was finally up on RAD and sold for a small profit. But 10 weeks…..Luckily for me, I did not need the money for something else…\n\nWhich goes into opportunity cost, if I needed the money I would probably take many losses because as the saying goes, cut your losers and buy winners. This goes into the positive momentum, green candles on charts. This is right, but what a chart does is try and show you sentiment in a stock and when it is starting to change. If you are down 50 cents on a play, but can make 1 dollar on the next cut your losses.\n\nThe main reason a successful trader/investor wants to take losses is tax harvesting. Imagine if by December 31st, all the positions you closed were winners and say you made 100,000…. You had unrealized losses of 50,000…. Do you know that you will have to pay taxes on the whole 100,000!? So December I will take losses to offset gains. Yes, if you take losses next year it can count against those gains with an additional 3,000 loss that can be used towards regular income…. However you already paid Uncle Sam..\n\nThese are the main reasons I take a loss, and yourself, thoughts, advice?</td>

      <td>Good morning everyone. Happy Saturday and thank you so much for taking a time out to read my post. I figured a topic like this can help others, or comfort others as well as share strategies so we can all do better, or make changes to be positive.\n\nWe are on an epic run of amazing proportions. I have been trading since the 90s and the Nasdaq boom, Nasdaq 5,000 at that time was epic…. However, nothing I have ever seen is even close to the Nasdaq dropping near 6,000 March 2020 and now record highs every single day 15,500+ in a short period… so I was curious for most of you which times were better. The first 4 months of trading/investing or the last 4 months…\n\nThis may sound odd because the DOW, SP, NASDAQ keep making new highs…however it is more of the blue chips and mega caps making new highs everyday. The Indexes and ETFS are all cap weighted except for the DOW, which means stocks like AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, FB, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA can carry the market to new highs without aid….\n\nFor myself, I actually am not hitting record highs, I do take a lot of money out for real estate but even if I did not I know I would not be…however the first 4 months I was! At that time a lot of the stocks I trade were making new highs. FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL especially….. JUNE/JULY for me were very rough and AUGUST I was coming back..\n\nPlease share some ideas, experience or strategies so we can all help one another. Thank you.</td>

      <td>Good evening everyone and thank you for taking the time to read my post. As the title suggests many stocks have doubled this week and last week. I have been banned on subs for naming tickers so I will not mention them here. You can message me, but the purpose of this post is so you too can be “The Genius”. Everyone wants to double their money right away, but do understand the risk associated with these stocks. Yes, you can double your money the same day or next day… but be ready to lose 50% as well..\n\nSo, I have 28 different watch lists.. The last time I actually counted was November of 2020, I had maybe 820 different tickers, and actually I had about 20 lists at that time. Over the last year I have edited/changed added lists and moved some stocks…I say this because it is very important what I do next. It is also important to add something moving to a watch list of your choice. I believe I have over 1,100 to 1,200 tickers on all different watch lists. The US market has between 12-13,000 tickers so I actually have 10% of the market at my fingertips.\n\nI usually around 7AM wake up, read the news online, turn on CNBC.. Check Yahoo finance, CNBC site… Soon after I will cycle thru my different watch lists, some that I already know have volatile speculation. If the stock that morning is up 10%, or has volume that looks like it will 2x average daily volume, I move it over to a list I call “Plays”. Why 10%? I have traded very long and my rule is 10%, it may be hot money today…..\n\nNext I will check Yahoo finance, TD for premarket movers, same rule if it is up 10% or looks like double volume I will add it to my plays and another list…. All the stocks that doubled the past 2 weeks were already on lists, because they were previously up 10% on high volume….. yes, I know that is a lot of stocks, hence I have 1,200 tickers. But hey, that is the secret so next time something takes off you will already be watching it. Good luck. Comment or share thoughts.</td>

      <td>Despite the run up the vast majority of short covering potential is yet to be lived out in SPRT. Sitting at about ~80% short interest with the cost to borrow is still around 200%, there is still a ton of lemon juice still in this that hasn’t been squeezed out. Not only this, but these two metrics have been drastically building up over the past two months, with little room between current levels and recent highs. These numbers, in addition to several other factors I’ll cover, may be daunting for a hedge fund that actually knows what they’re doing…if one exists. So what else will scare the bear out of them enough to bring this baby back en route to Pluto? Well…\n\nFor starters SPRT is a software company whose primary operation is technical support and customer service, manifesting through an integrated omni-channel experience. The company also owns a set of cybersecurity software solutions split into spyware, file storage, and identity protection. Their line of cybersecurity products will support their new venture into the crypto industry, a move that took form earlier this year.\n\nSPRT unveiled their new support service specifically oriented for cryptocurrency, blockchain, and FinTech just this past August. Being the go-to tech support company for the crypto industry will be easier when being able to provide clients cybersecurity solutions to bear additional privacy and security alongside their operations. To add to their software vertical, they also introduced in August a home-sourcing cloud platform that provides home-based users with enterprise management and workflow solutions, which will benefit them in the shifting work-at-home trend that is likely here to stay.\n\nThe primary way that SPRT has entered into the crypto industry, though, is through the proposed and soon completed reverse merger with Bitcoin miner Greenidge. The speculated share price places the post-merger valuation at around $5B, This is just higher than the market cap of its future competitors, Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT). Furthermore, it will very likely be worth more than these companies because it has the bread, and it has the butter. \n\nThe *bread* is that it has its own power plant, and in the Bitcoin mining industry, cheap energy can mean more bitcoin. For Greenidge (the company acquiring SPRT), it’s actually about 4x cheaper. This means that all that money saved in energy costs relative to competitors can be invested in more mining rigs to mine more Bitcoin.\n\nThe *butter* is that Greenidge is fully carbon-neutral. This presents a massive value wedge in an industry widely ridiculed for lack of sustainability. Bitcoin particularly has caught a lit of heat for being “dirty”, as a lot of it in China is mined using coal. But this green stamp of approval will bring the eyes of institutions— caught up in maintaining their own sustainability—toward the premier Bitcoin miner in the game. \n\nWe know that low float stocks are prime candidates for short squeezes. This is because with a lower supply of shares available, there is an easier chance to force the price upwards with a small amount of demand. SPRT’s float is tiny at 8M. For some perspective, GameStop’s float is 67M. The same dynamic goes for market cap, as less value to go around allows value to be eaten up by us squeezers more easily. SPRT’s market cap is ~500M, low enough to land it on the Russell Micro-Cap index. The percent of float on loan is sitting at around 55%, which is pretty high for stocks in general but even high for your average short squeeze as well. Short shares are near full utilization at 92% and this should keep the cost to borrow high because of the supply constraint and high demand.\n\nAnother promising aspect of this stock is there are already a great deal of institutions invested in SPRT, so even before the merger, the performance of this stock is partly in the hands of the big money that can really impact stock prices. To name a few invested in SPRT: Morgan Stanley, Blackrock, Vanguard, State Street, and dare I say… Citadel. Institutional ownership can create a cushion, where the stock is supported at a certain level because of the vast amount of big money shareholders that get in and play the long game. It is also nice to be on the side of the hedge funds in a short squeeze because then it is no longer David vs Goliath. It becomes David and Goliath vs Goliath’s idiot brother.\n\nSPRT has been on the Threshold Security List for over 35 days, and this will continue to flush out FTD’s (AKA forcing shorts that didn’t settle their failed positions to buy the stock they previously borrowed) as it has in the last few days to a small extent. Again, we shouldn’t count on hedge funds playing by the rules, but there are always some that will abide and it only makes the case stronger.\n\nAdditionally, the merger that is set to occur this month, which in this case will put naked short positions in limbo if they don’t get out of them because the CUSIP will change—from SPRT to GREE. Can’t rely too much on hedge funds not circumventing the rules, but because the stock actually changes, it might be something fairly difficult to get around. \n\nThe options for this stock have still been ranking highly in options volume (16th today), implied volatility (20th today), call/put ratio (74% today). This stuff is what we like to see for a gamma squeeze. Lots of trading, lot of price move potential from IV, and lots of calls to push that potential to the upside to force the notorious gamma.\n\nIn terms of exposure, we were on CNBC for two days in a row for crying out loud. We had essentially had our own segment. And you know we’ve been in every article about “Potential Short Squeezes” ever since this thing started ripping. Obviously SPRT has a pretty large following on Reddit, and not just in this sub but other smaller investing subs as well. \n\nThis stock is more than a one-hit-wonder. This is a stock extremely primed to squeeze and it will continue seeing the synergy of also having superior fundamentals. Sorry I didn’t do any charts or provide any links. This was off the dome. Godsqueeze.</td>

A covered call strategy is to sell one call option against 100 shares of stock, which effectively reduces the cost of the shares and creates partial downside protection. If the stock price is below the call's strike price at expiration, the investor will keep all of the premium which is the price they sold the call options. The downside of the strategy is that the investor gives up their upside potential on the shares above the strike price of the call.

It postulates that, holding all else equal, in a competitive market, the unit price for a particular good, or other traded item such as labor or liquid financial assets, will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied (at the current price), resulting in an economic equilibrium for price and quantity transacted. It forms the theoretical basis of modern economics.\n\n[https://youtu.be/J9mIYtA-MrM](https://youtu.be/J9mIYtA-MrM)</td>

      <td>Leaders at Austin-based Bumble Inc., which operates another popular dating app, are creating funds to aid Texas workers and their families affected by the state's new abortion law.\n\nThe law, which went into effect Wednesday, bars the procedure after about six weeks of pregnancy. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 vote late Wednesday, declined to block what is now the nation's toughest restrictions on abortions.\n\nWhen Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the legislation in May, the Republican said it "ensures that the life of every unborn child who has a heartbeat will be saved from the ravages of abortion."\n\nBumble said Wednesday it was setting up a similar fund for its workers. "Bumble is women-founded and women-led, and from day one we've stood up for the most vulnerable. We'll keep fighting against regressive laws like #SB8," the company said in a tweet.\n\nThe Texas Heartbeat Act, also known as SB 8, passed into law earlier this year by the Republican-controlled legislature. It says a physician can't knowingly perform an abortion if there is "a detectable fetal heartbeat." In practice, this restricts most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe law, which allows private citizens to file civil lawsuits to enforce the restrictions, left clinic directors, doctors and abortion-rights advocates adapting to the new measures Wednesday. Clinics were inundated with calls as patients sought guidance, and many abortion providers in the state were squeezing in patients and performing procedures until minutes before midnight, when the law took effect, according to clinic leaders.\n\nMr. Abbott, in a CNBC interview on Thursday, said business wasn't turned off by Texas's policies. He said Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk, who has growing businesses in Texas, had told him he liked the social policies in the state.\n\nAfter the governor's comments, Mr. Musk tweeted "I would prefer to stay out of politics." He also said in the tweet that he believed "government should rarely impose its will upon the people."\n\nMr. Musk last year said he moved to Texas from California and, at the time, took aim at Silicon Valley, arguing it had too much influence. Tesla is building a car plant near Austin and the billionaire's rocket venture, known as SpaceX, also has a facility in the state. Both companies also maintain large operations in California.\n\nAgree with it or not, this will get every activist on the bandwagon. Politics and beliefs aside, I want gainz. Thoughts?</td>

      <td>What are bull and bear spreads? Bull spreads and bear spreads strategies are commonly used by options traders to express their bullish or bearish views on an asset such as stocks, bonds, FX, or commodities. The benefit of this strategy is that it has a lower cost or risk than longing a call or put. But the cost is that the upside potential is limited. In this video, we will quickly walk you through the definitions, the structures, the payoffs, and real-life examples. Enjoy!\n\n[https://youtu.be/hWqV0vFCqXU](https://youtu.be/hWqV0vFCqXU)</td>

      <td>Alright, all caught up on why the fundamentals and cash flow generation make BGFV a fundamentals ATM? If not, put your La Croix and the September Good Housekeeping down and read for 5 minutes:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/pelvo1/bgfv\_irrational\_market\_has\_passed\_this\_one\_by\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/pelvo1/bgfv_irrational_market_has_passed_this_one_by_i/)\n\nThere has been a material shift in something important here that you NEED to follow: September call open interest and the possible setup of a gamma/short cover cycle. But let's recap for about 10 minutes first:\n\nRemember a few points from BGFV 101: \n\n**Low float with high institutional ownership:** 19.66 million share float, 56% institutional ownership at the end of Q2 (probably higher now). Why do we care? Most of these institutions are made up of **GIANT** ETFs and Russell index funds. They are not watching the tickers daily waiting for the right moment to buy or sell. They are building multi billion dollar portfolios that balance out market risk or track as a proxy to a certain sector or index. The ELI5 there: **Most of these are not selling any time soon!** Oh, and another point boys and girls. As stocks grow in market cap, they become eligible for inclusion in more indices and more ETFs that may have minimum market caps for inclusion. This can add fuel to a growth fire as more and more funds want a piece of a rising small cap that they couldn't previously add. Look at the funds buying in Q2: [https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/bgfv/ownership](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/bgfv/ownership)\n\nNotice a trend? Most of the largest funds adding are Russell 2000 funds from a previous position of 0. BGFV was re-added to the Russell 2000 and just like that, \~1,000,000 shares get snapped up. Microcap funds or others may drop it, and some did. But fund ownership almost always increases with market cap, especially as they gain membership in more large indicies. Gains beget more tutes buying in and high velocity share supply contracts.\n\n***Shares in play impact:*** We're at 56% now, but let's shave a few points off and say that we'll assume 40% of issuance owned right now excluding recent moves since reporting and high turnover funds. I think it is likely to move up from 56% the longer we hold over $500 million and future market cap milestones. But I'll invoke the Santorum rule and go conservative. \n\n40% of issuance = 9 million shares unlikely to move in the short term. 19.66 million float drops to \~10.6 million in play.\n\n**Shares on Loan to Shorts:** We don't know where the loaned shares are sourced from for the short interest. But we do know where some of it is NOT. Index and Mutual funds are prohibited by law from loaning out more than 50% of their unlevered positions to lend out to shorts. With \~10 million total with tutes, we can say that in a worst case scenario the shorts borrowed ALL available shares from institutions (5 million out of 7.7 million). \n\nBut that worst case scenario is not reality. Big tutes have reported somewhere in the range of 1-10% of their holdings being loaned out. Vanguard, the biggest dog, I found reported 2% on their largest funds. They could have loaned more of some stocks and less than others. But the interest rate on lending BGFV has been sitting between 0 and 1% for most of 2020/2021, the period when shorts were building their positions. **There was no incentive to loan out more BGFV than anything else in the portfolio. The tutes actual share count lent to shorts is very likely WELL under 1 million.** \n\nSantorum rule: we'll round up to 1 million double counted and pull that out. 7.7 million shorts minus 1 million = 6.7 million shares locked up with brokers not counted in institutional ownership. These shares can only be sold if the lending broker in turn replaces them by pulling from their pool of owned shares (which they likely hold very little BGFV given its small market cap and historical volume) or buying shares on open market to replace them, effectively offsetting the price impact of the selling shareholder. This is NOT a 1:1 removal of shares from the open market, especially if market selling volume takes off. But when more of the pressure is on the buy side with lending brokers and/or volume remains low-ish, it's like a cushion underneath the stock to soften drops from sales of sold shares. That downward price pressure is already baked in when the original short transaction took place.\n\nSo we've got 10.6 million moving around outside the tutes and \~6.7 million market sells worth of downward price pressure already baked in. The market is a weird thing, but we are set up so that only about **4 million** shares in the short term are changing hands in a way that meaningfully impacts the price. \n\n**How many shares are shorted again? Oh, they shorted 7.7 million? Those are going to be tough to close out should upward price movement force your hand. Would be a damn shame if you had to do so at a price significantly over the current market price.**\n\n**Which brings me to my last topic for today: Gamma.** September $30 call interest has grown significantly over the last few trading days. I believe I remember seeing 4,400 on Monday and now see over 7,600 contracts open. That is 760,000 shares that will need to be assigned if all contracts are exercised. That doesn't happen, but open interest is growing so quickly that even a 25% assignment rate at expiration is going to put some seriously **MAGNIFIED** upward price pressure when there may only 4 million shares out there up for grabs. If we clear $35 we are already looking at 3,400 open interest for September (and rising). We could be looking at 500,000+ shares of buy side pressure landing near options expiration date date of September 17th. \n\nNone of this takes in account any of the following:\n\n* Retail is buying this shit up lately. The more retail HODLs, the tighter the supply, the more violent the price action is likely to get. \n* Most of the managers and corporate employees have a VERY long tenure per their last 10-K filing. BGFV has also run an employee stock incentive program for some time. It's hard to say how many are owned by non-insider-reported employees, but it is certainly above zero and possibly immaterial to the very tight supply. How many "*Fred-the-25-year-store-manager-that-has-been-accumulating-since-the-IPO-in-2002-and-won't-sell-until-retirement"* are there taking even more supply off the market that we can't even account for?\n* Synthetics and naked shorts. The supply could be much larger than estimated if a significant share of the shorted shares are synth or naked. My not-financial-advice opinion in this case is: If they aren't synth or naked, fuck 'em and squeeze 'em. And if they are manipulating the supply with naked shorts, fuck 'em even more and sqeeze 'em harder.\n* Shorts commitment to fighting: We aren't talking about tens of billions of dollars with small cap BGFV. Large funds aren't likely to get margin called here. They probably have enough cash to keep their positions funded if they want to fighgt or wait sitting on a huge paper loss. But all it takes is a few big players to say 'fuck this, I'm out. You win Retail' for the window of escape to collapse.\n* What was posted is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in the rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this subreddit is now dumber for having read it. We award you no karma, and may God have mercy on your soul.\n\n**So go read the fundamentals from part 1 again, take a cold shower, and ask yourself if you are ready to strap your goddamn seat belts on and moon this shit.**\n\nNone of this is financial advice. I am not a broker, insider, registered Libertarian, or Costco member. Do not act on my advice alone. I am merely sharing my opinion based on publicly available data. I might be wrong, I might be right, I just may be the lunatic you're looking for.\n\nI like the stock.</td>

      <td>Update: 10:25pm 9/1/21\n\n \n22nd Century (XXII) Q2 Revenues up 30% YoY, a New Board Member and a Good Level of Liquid Assets\n \nGood day everyone,\n \nWe are continuing coverage on 22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII), a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research and hops.\n \nCurrent price​​​$3.37/share (at Market close Sep.1, 2021)\n \nAfter XXII shares retreated in early trading during the Wednesday session, I said the shares would find support at $3.30/share and both trading volume and the share price would increase throughout the day. That’s exactly what happened. We note that the company shares are up in after-hours trading.\n \nEarlier in August, XXII released its Q2 earnings report. Revenues for the quarter, ended June 30th were $8.37M (+30%) compared to $6.44M in the same quarter in 2020. Loss per share was at $.03, the same as the loss per share in Q2 2020. Revenues are mainly generated from the sale of VLN cigarettes.\n \nThe Q2 earnings report also reported $2.0M in cash and $60.2M in marketable securities that were mostly money market funds.\n \nThere are more than 1 billion global and 34 million U.S. adult smokers. More than two-thirds of adult smokers want to quit, yet less than ten percent of them can quit successfully. XXII believe that smokers are actively seeking alternatives to addictive combustible cigarettes. Based on their consumer perception studies, 60% of adult smokers indicate a likelihood to use VLN®.\n \nI believe revenues at XXII will explode after their MRTP application is approved and the VLN cigarette product can be properly marketed. The company has stated they are ready to mass produce within 90 days of the MRTP approval.\n \nI watched a video interview with CEO James Mish, recorded on August 19th. He discusses the company product sectors, even the hop plant (without naming it). It’s worth watching.\n \n7/23/2021​Cowen  Initiated Coverage   Outperform    $5.00\n \nXXII has been smart in their approach to the cannabis market. They have chosen to invest in, and partner with existing companies in the sector CannaMetrix, genetics to deliver differentiated traits to maximize yield of a specific cannabinoid or deliver a certain taste or fragrance profile, KeyGene, and commercial-scale plant breeding and cultivation of disruptive plant lines as well as year-round ingredient extraction/purification (Extractas Bioscience, Sawatch Agriculture, Folium Botanical, Aurora Cannabis, Needle Rock Farms, and Panacea). The company is limiting its US research to the hemp plant as cannabis is still illegal.\n \nThe entry into the hop plant sector seems to be a logical move for the company. With their technology and know-how, XXII is likely to find eager partners in the sector. Just as it is in the cannabis sector, XXII will be able to approach existing companies in the sector and say, “whatever compounds you need from the plant, we can engineer it to produce more of them.” The XXII technology has the potential to reduce the hop plant modification timeline from 10 years to 2 years. And remember, XXII is already 6 months into the process.\n \nOn August 19th the company announced the appointment of Anthony Johnson to its Board of Directors. Mr. Johnson is an accomplished life sciences and biotechnology executive leader with broad expertise in corporate strategy, technology development, marketing, and business development. Mr. Johnson has an impressive resume along with global experience. You can read about his history at the link.\n \n\nOriginal report below\n\n 22nd Century (XXII) Made a Good Choice Bringing the Hop Plant into Its Family of Plants to Modify  \n\n\nWill the FDA Give Traction to Their VLN Cigarettes Soon?  \n\n\nGood day everyone,  \n\n\nWe are continuing coverage on **22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII),** a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.  \n\n\nCurrent price $3.3/share (at 10:00 AM EDT)  \n\n\nAfter closing at $3.57/share in the Tuesday session, XXII shares began looking for a level of support in early trading today. I believe a support level at $3.30/share will bring buyers in and we will see increasing volume and price throughout the day.  \n\n\nRemember, tobacco is still the flagship product at XXII and generates their revenues. For the FDA, the decisions on Juul and other manufacturers could represent a milestone as it tries to execute an ambitious tobacco regulation agenda. The FDA in April said it was taking steps to ban menthol cigarettes. And it continues to work on a potential requirement that nicotine levels in cigarettes be set at minimally addictive levels, a possible game-changer that the White House would need to approve. It’s possible XXII may see a mandate and approval announced together.  \n\n\nThe hop plant market is not as highly regulated as tobacco or hemp/cannabis, providing a faster path to commercialization. If you have followed XXII you know they have been waiting a while for the FDA to approve their ability to advertise their VLN cigarettes as a safer alternative to standard tobacco. We all know that cannabis remains classified as a schedule one drug by the US government.  \n\n\nHop and hemp/cannabis plants have many similarities. Both are part of the Cannabaceae family of alkaloid flowering plants and the active ingredients found in both plants offer potential health benefits for managing anxiety, inducing calm, addressing sleeping disorders and resolving stomach problems, among other wellness applications.  \n\n\nThe fact that hop, and cannabis plants are similar is important because XXII has already done a lot of R&amp;amp;amp;D, including that done by its cannabis partner companies, that may apply to hop plants creating new proprietary plants. Let’s remember that XXII has valuable plant modification IP and know-how including utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other technology they have developed in tobacco and cannabis.  \n\n\nThe hop plant has been grown and used to make beer for centuries (possibly millennia) without modification. XXII has picked a plant to be the third leg in in its plant modification tripod that is ready to be improved and expanded.  \n\n\n  \n**original report below** \n\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n22nd Century (XXII) Announces the Completion of Its Trifecta of Market Sectors with Tobacco, Cannabis, and Now Hops\n\nMassive IP portfolio on the Tobacco and Cannabis Plants. **Now hops also?** I would say they have all major areas covered. (I will dive more into that later) no pun intended.\n\nGood day everyone,\n\nInitiating coverage on **22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII),** a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.\n\nCurrent price $3.57/share (at market close Aug. 31, 2021)\n\nOn August 16, 2021, XXII moved to the NASDAQ Exchange from the NYSE-American. The company participated in the closing bell ceremony on the same day. The company believes the move will increase their visibility and exposure to investors.\n\nWhen I look at [the company stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=XXII), I see how XXII has come off recent dips this year. On April 26th, the shares peaked at $6.07, then dipped to $3.56 on May 13th. On July 1st the shares had climbed back to $4.63 before consolidating to today’s level. XXII shares have now crossed their 200 DMA of $3.34 and are **approaching their 50 DMA of $3.67/share in a bullish manner**.\n\nI often note insider holdings as a value metric because the insiders have a vested interest in the company’s success. Insider ownership isn’t very high (under 3%) at XXII, but the institutional ownership (all data per YF) is at 36.4% of the outstanding shares. **Some of the big guns are holding XXII shares like Blackrock (5.99%) and Vanguard (4.68%). ETF Managers Group is holding 7.38% of the company’s shares.** Hedge funds prefer the companies they invest in to perform sooner rather than later.\n\nWhen we last covered XXII in July, we talked about the company’s trifecta of core products, tobacco, cannabis, and an unknown third leg. I spent some time trying to figure out what that third product was going to be. Since XXII was already in the tobacco and cannabis sectors I thought the new market would be psilocybin. Boy was I wrong. While psilocybin is an exciting and developing market, it is still relatively small and in it’s infancy. XXII doesn’t chase small markets.\n\nIn a [letter to shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/22nd-century-group-enters-global-132000137.html) published Monday, August 30th, CEO James Mish said “I am proud to announce our third plant-based franchise – the global **specialty hops market**. Like our existing franchises, the hop plant market is ripe for disruption and offers opportunities for 22nd Century to provide unique and significant competitive advantages to commercial partners. The addition of hops, a critical input for the $500 billion global brewing industry as well as a growing source of medically-important molecules, expands our total addressable markets to an estimated $1.3 trillion.”\n\n95% of all hops are used to make beer. The rising demand for microbrew and craft beers is driving the specialty hops market where distinctive flavors, aromas and nutritional uses are important in creating unique and differentiated products. The XXII R&amp;amp;amp;D program objectives include creating new proprietary hop plants and valuable IP using their know-how and technologies, utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other non-GMO technology.\n\nXXII is establishing a new subsidiary in the Netherlands, 22nd Century Group Europe B.V., to open new revenue opportunities in hops, as well as serve their tobacco and hemp/cannabis plant franchises through an expanded global footprint.\n\nXXII is on the move now with a move toward globalization and a new product pipeline that may generate revenues quickly. The demand for proprietary, specialized, non-GMO hops is high and XXII has the tools to provide them.\n\n7/23/2021 Cowen Initiated Coverage Outperform $5.00\n\n**On the tobacco front**, earlier in August, the company announced that they were highly confident their MRTP (modified risk tobacco products) application has completed the FDA’s scientific review process and is now in the documentation process, the final stage before the FDA announces its decision. While the company’s VLN cigarettes were approved for sale in 2019, this important designation will allow 22nd Century to communicate key features of VLN® King and VLN® Menthol King, including the headline claim of “95% less nicotine.” VLN® tastes, smells, and smokes like a conventional cigarette. Both the FDA and the Biden administration have been looking for ways to curb illness, and consequently healthcare expenses, associated with cigarette smoking.\n\n**On the cannabis front**, XXII has been building its network of partnerships to maximize the upstream segment of the cannabinoid value chain since 2019. Components of 22nd Century’s proprietary value chain include: plant profiling tailored to the needs of customers (CannaMetrix), genetics to deliver differentiated traits to maximize yield of a specific cannabinoid or deliver a certain taste or fragrance profile (KeyGene), and commercial-scale plant breeding and cultivation of disruptive plant lines as well as year-round ingredient extraction/purification (Extractas Bioscience, Sawatch Agriculture, Folium Botanical, Aurora Cannabis, Needle Rock Farms, and Panacea).\n\nThe XXII “trifecta” of market sectors it participates in is now complete with tobacco, cannabis, and hops. As CEO Mish pointed out above, these three sectors address an **estimated market of $1.3T**. Sometimes we get lost with those numbers but each **1% of a $1.3T market potential is $13B**.\n\nStay tuned for more coverage on 22nd Century Group coming very soon.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 22nd Century Group, Inc.22nd Century Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: XXII) is a leading plant biotechnology and intellectual property company focused on improving health and wellness through plant science. 22nd Century uses modern plant breeding technologies, gene-editing, and molecular breeding to deliver value to its customers in the life science and consumer products industries by creating new, proprietary tobacco, hemp/cannabis and hop plants with optimized alkaloid and flavonoid profiles as well as improved yields and valuable agronomic traits. 22nd Century was founded to build intellectual property related to nicotine biosynthesis in the tobacco plant and to commercialize its proprietary reduced nicotine content (RNC) tobacco plants, which have become the cornerstone of FDA’s comprehensive plan to address the enormous amount of death and disease caused by addiction to smoking. **The Company has also begun to leverage its plant science expertise and existing partnerships to create and commercialize new, proprietary hemp/cannabis and hop plants to optimize their genetics and create valuable new intellectual property.**\n\n[Privacy policy and disclaimer](https://mailchi.mp/tradersnewssource/exciting-report-in-a-hot-sector-coming-tomorrow-649728?e=[UNIQID])</td>

      <td>Okay you guys and gals, I'm back. Yes this has been a bloodbath. No getting around that.\n\nIn order for a squeeze to happen it requires 2 things: Public Interest &amp;amp; Share Buying. \n\nInvestors often make the mistake of going "well X factors and Y factors have happened so long as you've done the DD remain Bullish." The problem is that the general public are NOT investors and have no idea, nor are even aware of x or y factors. Those things simply have no affect on them. The general public is ONLY aware of hype. They have to see it enough, they have to hear it enough, they have to be shown proof that it's going...UP. That's right. While DD will keep investors happy to buy as the share price drops, a downward trend will scare off the general public. They only buy when things are going up. The stock has taken a beating and everyday has dripped down slowly but surely. That tells me that bulls are doing their best to hold on but even they are losing conviction by the hour. Thus the slow decline down. This stock needs a fresh new injection of public interest in order to spike up the price. Just the truth. Bulls have either spent all they can, or exited without plan to return in the near future. **The idea now is to flood YouTube Twitter Facebook etc with DD on $SPRT and well detailed explanations of WHY the si% increase is bullish- with examples and data given.** Target accounts with large followings, especially those related to energy/tech/crypto, because that's how you will reach the largest audiences possible. Tons of YouTube videos etc. That newfound sentiment has to be garnered. Write articles and publish them so people searching up the stock come across them. Things like that. Strategic planning. Just the truth. Eventually news will pick it up and wonder why so many articles have been written, why it's being discussed all over social media, etc. $GME at the beginning of the year had dedicated Bulls that ensured the public interest was extremely high. \n\nNext up is Share Buying. The concept is simple enough. Buy shares. Again Bulls are mostly spent. So this plays in tandem with the Public Interest support. Buying otm options at this point is a waste of money until this begins to trend upwards. \n\nWe have a long weekend coming up, monday is labor day. Every Friday the past month, the stock has spiked. It will happen again this Friday. Shorts generally do not like holding ver the weekend. They certainly will not want to hold over the long weekend. What am I saying? The best plan of action is to flood the internet and garner as much public interest on $SPRT by Friday. This will invoke a massive share buying process, forcing shorts to cover a higher si than before- with a lower float than before. Again the long weekend is coming up. If you read this, and are bullish, give at least one of those things a try. At the very least spread the general message as much as possible. Not just on reddit but across social media platforms. Again, the general public is the audience.</td>

      <td>I have just done a cursory overview of BGFV (Big 5) stock and it seems like free money. Full disclosure: I'm loading up on some September and December calls, but this isn't just to shill. What the hell is going on with this stock to keep it down so low? \n\n**NOTE:** I wrote this up last night and they popped this AM. Some ratios or numbers might not reflect the run from this morning. \n\nReasons I see it exploding:\n\n* **A P/E under 5 (FIVE!)** that is NOT due to some one off income recognition. They are doing this      while talking at length on the earnings call about supply chain issues holding them back. EPS looks sustainable to me.\n* **Healthy balance sheet**. NO DEBT. $118 million in cash meaning market cap less cash is only \~$400 million or \~4x earnings.\n* **Growth has not reverted since reopening**: same store sales are way up over both 2020 and 2019      for pre-pandemic comps. They are trickling in a few new stores this year, but only have a footprint in a few states, so there is big expansion room if they choose to deploy their huge cash surplus to fund it. \n* **They print cash**: Free cash flow in the next year is looking like something around $200 million per year based on the last few quarters and Q3 guidance. At current prices, they could literally buy back 30% of their float PER YEAR and not take out any debt to do it. \n* **They upped their dividend to 4%, but that is still barely makes a dent in use of their cash flow**. Last quarter they gave a special dividend of $1 per share ($20 million total) and STILL built up almost $20 million in cash. They have so much money coming in that they don't know what to do with it, so are just cutting checks to shareholders. \n* **They are shorted in to oblivion - but the short attack      looks to be over.** Maybe      this is why the price is as low as it is? At last report they had almost 8      million shares shorted or 40% of float, a jump of 3.5 million shares in      just the last 6 weeks. The fee on renting shares is up to 10-15% in the      last week, so the supply of shares available to borrow to short seems to      have dried up. Whoever blinks first and closes out a large position may      just be the start of a quick turnaround. \n* **Institutions buying up in bulk** \- Fintel shows 16 million owned by tutes, other resources say \~10.5 million. Either way, that is a healthy cut of float and it is GROWING QUICKLY. The filings that have landed in August so far show $62 million in net inflows in Q2 (over 3 million shares worth). Most      of the shares are in big 401k type funds or index funds. They are not in for the short term. Remember those 8 million shorts hanging around out there? The supply of moving shares to close those positions is drying up quickly. I'm not it in for a squeeze, but the ingredients are all there.\n\nI challenge you to come up with one sound reason (other than an irrational market) for why this stock should one of the best buys on the market.</td>

      <td>Decisions, decisions…. We all make decisions in life, from what we will wear in the morning, what we will eat today and who we will marry. It is wild that some of these decisions especially who we will marry may take months, or even years to decide…..and yet when it comes to YOLO on a stock/option with 10-20,000 or even a life savings that some of us will just pull the trigger without any DD. Yes, SPRT did go from under 10 Monday to 60 Friday, but how many of us are going to catch that at the right time? Everyone wants the next SPRT…. There does seem to be a short squeeze a play on BBIG, ATER, ROOT but be careful! I get asked this quite a lot especially this week after SPRT. There are people saying they want to bet big!\n\nI am not saying do not buy the stock/option I am saying maybe we should do some research or place small bets. I too, in this market are playing them more often, however I am using 1-2% of my account to trade them. It can turn your 10,000 into 50,000 in a week, but how will you feel if you have 5,000? I can name 10 grenades past 2 weeks that shot up to the moon and did a crash landing on earth. So please be careful in what we decide.\n\nI still trade a lot of defensive plays but I am mixing in some of these grenades… I am willing to take a loss on them if I must. I have 2 grenades PMCB, NOAV that I am down slightly on.. No options. \n\nAlso, it is important not to convince ourselves that this is a fundamental move. Yes, their could be actual news, and usually actually news starts a rise, however this market is extreme, buyers/sellers pile on more than ever on good and bad news.. This doesn’t mean your stock now has the cure for covid, cancer, is going to win a huge contract.\n\nI would say to have an idea of the profit you have in mind 10-20% and take some off the table when you are up, because you don’t want to be a bag holder when the cure for cancer fails.\n\nGood luck everyone.</td>

      <td>Recently I started a trading strategy around earnings releases. These periods tend to experience movements and volatility that can make for good opportunities in options trading. These types of trades are also riskier than other periods because of a lot of factors playing against you, like time decay and especially the IV crush that happens after the release, making most bought options worthless by itself.\n\nLike most things, the market prices-in the expected volatility and movements of the stock prices around earnings. By studying iv and other factors, one can actually estimate this market expectation.\n\nUsually traders prefer to be on the sell side of options before earnings to take advantage of the iv crush and a stock price movement that stays within the market expectation. However, a lot of stocks end up beating this expected move for a multitude of reasons: way better or worse results ending in investors adjusting their positions, but also a detail in the report or guidance can shift expectations, and anyway the stock ends up moving more than expected move. This make for very profitable options trades when we are on the buy side and we actually hold through earnings. The goal here is to spot these companies.\n\nIdea\n\nThe main idea of the approach here is to let the data speak for itself. The end goal is to build a classification model that “spots” companies likely to beat market expectation, First we need to define that expectation. A first approximation can be to consider the average of the historic moves and add some offset as a multiplier of its standard variation. If we are able to predict if a company is likely to move higher than what it used to do it can be a first clue to look deeper and assess options opportunities.\n\nFeatures\n\nSince I’m not aiming at predicting a particular direction of movement, I will be mostly using features that reflect the market behaviour around earnings for every stock. I will use 3 categories of features:\n\n\- **Company related**Sector of activity, market cap, size of shareholders, time since ipo, ..\n\n\- **Earnings related**I am looking at the behaviour of the stock price, stock volume and options values around earnings. For every company, I calculated the movement occurring in each indicator every day the week of the earnings, and record the maximum in absolute value. The learning set needs to have historic occurrences so we can use the actual values of these indicators to make predictions. An example of these features looks like this for TSLA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fq6c31nllbk71.png?width=1350&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2e82f6181163e6fef327f4a4dc1b15efde5c5f07\n\n\- **News related**The goal here is to let the model know how news coverage may help predict a big movement around earnings that would beat the market expectation. We need an indicator of this coverage, so we will use the number of articles as well as a sentiment score. I scrapped all pages of [investorshub.](https://investorshub.advfn.com/)com every day and classified articles by date and stock concerned with the news. I then run Vader algorithm for news sentiment extraction so we can obtain a score by day reflecting how positive or negative the news was. I then record the average positive and negative score for the last 30 days before each earnings date. Here is a sample :\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2jqr95aolbk71.png?width=1342&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=31e7a7286b6c5d1eb4eff571c36d7d3f6d656d79\n\n# Target\n\nNow that we have all these indicators going back to 2015, we can add the target we will be looking for. We are interested in an actual stock move that outperforms the expected one, that we define it to be the average of historic move. For each date, we can then average the previous movements and set our classification to target to either 1 if the actual absolute move is higher than the average at that point and 0 otherwise.\n\nWe end up with a dataset of +300k releases and approximately 30% of the observations have a positive target.\n\n# Model\n\nThe next step is to actually train our machine learning model and study the results. A lot of important data-science steps are involved that I will not dive into, for example we need our model to not overfit and actually be able to compare the results versus a random model and use a score metric that actually makes sense. The model used here is [xgboost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost), as it is a natural extension of an intuitive model that we an actually interpret (I will write up a dedicated article about all this).\n\nWe obtain a decent performance over all stocks of around 60%, with some having very high predictability by our model which is what we aim for. Here is a graph of the distribution of the model scores across all stocks. The score used is the [roc score.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xo5l7vuqlbk71.png?width=1342&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a4122088f95c07da1cdfd2df907096636c954388\n\n# Results\n\nTo backtest our approach, we can look at how our model behaved on previous predictions and compare them with actual outcomes. This should be coherent with the scores and results obtained above if the preprocessing and processing we did was correct.\n\nLooking at the last two months, we can calculate the difference between the actual move and the target the model predicted the stock would beat, we see that when filtering for stocks with probability &amp;gt; 60% and a general roc score higher than 55%, the realised performance is actually a bit higher than the expected 60% (which makes sense since we’re keeping only high predictions and those the model is most confident about):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/avwwlsfwlbk71.png?width=1392&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9afc01e995e8ce4fc3b9df0dfeaba1f5591028f0\n\nThis model is behind the data and recommendations of [earnings-watcher.tech](http://earnings-watcher.tech/) where you can browse into what was discussed here.\n\nI use the platform to calibrate for my options trades around earnings for the high risk / high reward positions like discussed in the beginning. I wrote [this articl](https://medium.com/@EarningsWatcher/picking-options-for-risky-earnings-trades-2d49dcb847e)e about that process.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6vsfc4f0mbk71.png?width=3360&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3508ad717cd41df37dfb9293bffc8b01a0bc56f8\n\nHope you enjoy and let me know what you think!</td>

      <td>Even after the sell off Friday afternoon SPRT is still 50% above Thursday’s standard market hour closing price. Some believe the setup is very similar to what happened to GME and this alone is worth keeping an eye on for myself. \n\nDo I know whether it is mainstream targeting GME/AMC trying to distract everybody, no I do not. Do I know if this is a legit short squeeze setup not fueled by pump and dump tactics, no I do not. I do know that this has a lot of volume and potentially a lot of volatility. This is everything a trader should be looking for in a stock. Nobody is asking you to marry SPRT, I do believe it is worth keeping an eye on for potential profits. At the end of the day we are all here for the same thing, we want profits. If you do decide to get involved with SPRT know your risk and have a plan going in. It can obviously go bad before you realize you’ve lost your ass.\n\nHere is the opinion from a popular Korean GME website.\n\n\nhttps://m-dcinside-com.translate.goog/mini/gmemeltdown/17564?_x_tr_sl=ko&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=ajax,nv,elem\n\nThis is from the subreddit also showing similarities in the two.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SPRT/comments/pdzkyu/sprt_is_just_getting_started_incoming_ftd_crisis/?utm_source=amp&amp;amp;utm_medium=&amp;amp;utm_content=post_body</td>

      <td>Hey everyone,\n\nI'll be looking at **Apple** in this case using [**FINLO**](https://finlo.io/), just for the sake of this post.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4djirk6pak71.png?width=1559&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ae2daae1af9af20ea879a57bb06d85c565b2bcd6\n\n# Profile\n\nIt may sound silly but making sure the company you're looking at is real is a big part of Due Diligence. It's a quick and easy thing to verify that can save you a lot of headache later on.\n\n**Go through all the basics:**\n\n* Where is the company located?\n* Who are the Key Executives?\n* Look through their website\n* Find out what they do\n* How many employees do they have?\n* News Articles\n* Insider Trades: Who's making them?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jongcly6pak71.png?width=1561&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4d0c21577b9b3850615b872d2522daac3bc7c860\n\n# Financials\n\nThis part is harder to explain since each of us have certain criteria when looking through financial data. But regardless of what you consider most important, it's essential that you understand these reports. Spend time looking through the numbers, ask yourself questions and get a feel for the financial health of the company. Is it investing more? Are margins improving? Are their cash reserves sufficient to cover debts? Go through everything.\n\n**Financial Statements:**\n\n**Annual &amp;amp; Quarterly Financials**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jdrytul7pak71.png?width=1560&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=50ddbcf52adcfc3eff9a9732fc64c8ed3f02fd9e\n\n**YoY &amp;amp; QoQ Growth**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8cul4c08pak71.png?width=1558&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c398de4ee667ab1d5ca5079e92fb83fc0ef3b7b6\n\n**Ratios &amp;amp; Metrics**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wj4djdv8pak71.png?width=1558&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=22f604ea8e34f2cfcc14039426ace11ba7832258\n\n# Analyst Estimates, Upgrades / Downgrades and Historical DCF\n\nI like to take a look at what Analysts predict will happen in the next couple of years. There are just predictions of course so take them with a grain of salt, but they can help. Upgrades / Downgrades are useful as well, Investment Banks have large teams that work on these ratings. Lastly a look at current and Historical DCF figures helps me see how the market has and is valuing the company compared to it's fair value based on fundamentals.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t65qp2w9pak71.png?width=1564&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c953858d055c804a6bca950fd28df6697ead95a3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/udxky1w9pak71.png?width=1558&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b290d2740131854de0e657a09082c6c8f4ed1480\n\n# Fundamental Analysis\n\nThis is the most important part of my process. Now that I have looked at the various financial data I like to put it all together to see how it all fits together as well as seeing YoY or QoQ growth. By combining my favorite or go-to data points I can often find patterns or at least make connections that may support or go against my thesis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uv8p7xaapak71.png?width=1558&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b8b7940b020e9df9992c62efaa5081278fdfd5ff\n\n# Documents\n\nReading through SEC filings (10K's, 10Q's, Proxies, Prospectuses etc) as well as Earning Call Transcripts are essential parts of my process. So much amazing information can be found in these filings. It takes a little patience but it's most definitely worth doing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7mqnbwoapak71.png?width=1560&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4946e035eac5e54a4f2a1e0bdbfcd530b47fbef9\n\n# Ownership\n\nIt's always good to know which Funds and Institutions own the company you're looking at. When did they buy share? How many? At what Price?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wtiu584bpak71.png?width=1548&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=af3bfbd81dd8b6bdd2ba8a04e33484ee8903f740\n\n# Price Charts\n\nI look at price charts to find any large fluctuation in price. I then find out when the large moves happened and go back looking for articles, press releases, social media posts to try and understand what caused them. This helps me understand what has historically effected the price of a company so that as I track and monitor it I can hopefully spot things in advance.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2rmdy5hbpak71.png?width=1563&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e1baa84a06cb4318249951b336d7a90d22f32baa</td>

      <td>This market more than ever is irrational. I have been trading since late 1994 and have been thru the dot com crash.. Greenspan's "Irrational Exuberance", 9/11 when the market was shut down for days, 2008 crash and last year's covid.. I swear I have never seen anything even close to this!\n\nBack in the late 90s and even when the Nasdaq crashed in March of 2000, you would have a handful of stocks down 10-20% in a single day. You may have a handful of stocks with volume over 10 million.. Check the history! Now you have stocks up 200% and down the next day 50% I cant mention the ticker here or I will get banned. But there are many stocks that go down 15-20% on nothing! SLQT went down 50% on a slight miss Thursday!   \n\n\nI feel now more than ever there are gamblers everywhere. Everyone piles on on positive or negative news quickly...because of social media.. We know.....\n\nSo my question is, has it changed the way you trade/invest and how?   \n\n\nFor myself I am quickly adapting........ I am actually trading more momentum stocks than I ever traded before.. Companies with horrible financials... which is hard for me, but we have to adapt or get killed on SLQT??\n\nPlease share ideas, I am trying to adapt as quickly as possible too!</td>

      <td>I wanted to share with you a typical analysis I do on stocks in preparation of trades around their earnings, and we're looking into the crow's favourite $AMC!\n\nThe goal here is to bet on tail events happening around earnings. Like most things, the market expects a certain movement of the stock price that is priced in in the options plays. Buying strangles or straddles with closest expirations the day before release is a very risky trade as iv crush and time decay are against us, but if higher move than expected occur, they are huge money printers and that's what we aim at. I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarningsWatcher/comments/p2hbw4/picking_options_for_risky_earnings_plays/) post about these plays if you're interested.\n\nFirst I like to start by looking at the [price chart with earnings dates highlighted](https://earnings-watcher.tech/#/company?symbol=AMC), just to get a sense of the general movement of the stocks around releases and overall.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z22c2ffgbyj71.png?width=3026&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=662db7026091d104c20180ff716dcf3a3c6bb831\n\nIt looks like the market is pretty reactive around earnings for AMC. Let's confirm that by looking at historic numbers. This is a summary of [stock movements for the last 5 releases:](https://earnings-watcher.tech/#/company?symbol=GME)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v8fze6ofbyj71.png?width=1460&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=41c26e68ed18abd6b0ee67ee740365fb563cc9cd\n\nFor each release, we see the actual movement that happened, compared to the average historic move and standard deviation (a metric of dispersion basically) computed then. The average historic move is usually a good approximation of the movement expected by the market, and we want to know if AMC usually beats this expectation. We can see that AMC consistently has beaten its average move, except for one release, with more than 20% move the week of earnings last year.\n\nCurrently, the market expectation of movements based on all historic moves is around 12.1% with a standard deviation of 5.7%. This means that the stock usually moves in a window of 0 to 14% most of the time, and any movement higher than that would be the market expectation.\n\nNow the goal is to see how likely is AMC to beat that 14% threshold for our options to be profitable.\n\n[earnings-watcher.tech](https://earnings-watcher.tech/) developed a machine learning model that uses features from historic movements in stocks, volume, news coverage etc to predict if a stock is likely to move higher than the expectations. This basically tries to detect patterns that are relevant in predicting these movements. Let's see what they have in store for AMC\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hdsv3vpdbyj71.png?width=1152&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=850fca21713eb23081271e88d6a39be0703315c8\n\nThe model is giving a high probability of big movement 82%, but is not really confident on predictions made on AMC previously as we see in the model score 50% (the score here is ROC score for classification, taking into account the rarity of the events we look for). How did it find that ? This is the pattern the model identified:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/718uv2adbyj71.png?width=2912&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4bfecad96a9a5f5274fd02467c8f2f4ffd7fb70b\n\nThe model found that companies with an average movement and std dev. of around 5%, combined with market cap and the fact the median move of the last three earnings is around 30%, usually beat expectations. This pattern is statistically significant, meaning that any other variation of these features would not help predict a big movement, and the model was able to isolate this pattern. \n\nWe can also take a look at previous patterns the model found in predicting AMC earnings move:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7imo69zabyj71.png?width=2832&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9da90582a8152751e8db94f024f69d45cd05706f\n\nFor example, back in 2018-11-08, the model identified a pattern based on average historic move being around 11%, market expectation a bit lower at 10% and especially a price variation of +20% during last earnings. This pattern occurred 7 other times and had an accuracy of 71%, meaning that one third of stocks showing this pattern during their earnings ended up beating market expectations.\n\nWe can finally take a look at the [strangles and straddles prices](https://earnings-watcher.tech/#/company?symbol=GME) for AMC\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/61r28sbabyj71.png?width=2758&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=39fe57478457d01dffa689246b47600a082164e6\n\nThe minimum break even is around 60% (with very high volatility), meaning for these options to be profitable, there needs to be approximately a 60% move, which is close to the market expectation the model was aiming at. This calculation is very conservative as it only takes into account the options intrinsic value at expiration!\n\nWell, AMC is not the perfect stock for a machine learning model to sport opportunity as it has all of reddit backing it up but at least you use how we can use this!\n\nEnjoy and let me know what you think!</td>

      <td>Hi everyone,\n\nThis is a follow up on posts of about some statistics and a machine learning model trained to spot big movements around earnings.\n\nThe goal here is to bet on tail events happening around earnings. Like most things, the market expects a certain movement of the stock price that is priced in in the options plays. I was interested in stocks with a heavy tail that can move more than this threshold to make strangles plays very profitable (but very risky if no tail). I compiled historic data of price and iv movements around releases, and trained an ML model to detect stocks likely to beat the market expectation, that i approximate to be the average of historic movements. This gives me a list of stocks that I then study to pick my risky option plays.\n\nLast week, the model recommend $NFH and $PNBK ([this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarningsWatcher/comments/p8kgsl/stocks_most_likely_to_beat_market_expectation_of/) post) that ended up moving 1.1% and 4.2% respectively.

      <td>Small cap Biotechs are risky (but reward is related to risk) and have high volatility ( beta) but can reward with nice  returns from a TRADING standpoint- hence one has to watch the share price frequently and take profits as soon as they spike on good news ( as my recommendation to take profits on Wed after hours on AMRX ). I have been trading in these for last couple of years and the school of hard knocks combined with nice profits has let me conclude that one must have a combo of 3 to 5 to protect against risk. At this point my three favorites which have all corrected, then completed a consolidation and IMHO (and I could be 100pct wrong ! on one or more of them) are $EVAX $GTBP $CLLS with equal amounts .\n\nYou need to do your own evaluation and establish your own buy points. Ofcourse trying to be smart and cherry pick one is more a gamble than a trading strategy and money is better spent on a weekend trip to Vegas.\n\nPS: For the more conservative and long term holders the two blue chips paying nice dividends and can also be put in an IRA account are $PFE, $GILD</td>
