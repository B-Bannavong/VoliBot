      <td>This started about 4 years ago when my son was 2 years old. I started to supplement his picture books and cartoons with beginner options books and Martin Shkerli's live videos on how to pick pharmaceutical stocks. Over the course of these years I feel like he has retained absolutely nothing even though I have spent every waking minute trying to make him understand. I have done almost everything that I have thought of including having Jerome Powell's speeches play while he is sleeping and  only having Warren Buffet on the TV to try and make him understand the market.  I felt as though I got to a breaking point when he couldn't differentiate between a straddle and a strangle even though we we went through different strategies for almost a month straight. I finally convinced my wife that we were doing the right thing when I said that he will soon be a Wendy's worker begging his wife's husband for a weekly allowance because he will never amount to be anything.  I couldn't fathom  raising a kid who was not able to able to make a profit from trading options by the time he was 10. With all that said if anyone wants a 6 year old child who is shitty at market strategy check out Eternal Sunny Orphanage in Omaha, Nebraska and maybe your luck will be better than mine with him.</td>

      <td>TLDR: Meta Materials inc go BRRR\n\nShort interest high, momentum going up.  High conviction entry.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4e5m8416etk71.jpg?width=1579&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cdc44d3de0a7f1b6c562020aa56528c1513ad711\n\nWe are looking at the 1 day chart below and 2 indicators. The yellow indicator is RSI with a divergence line rather than overbought and oversold lines. The blue indicator is on balance volume.\n\nDrawing a horizontal line on both indicators on where they closed today you can see the last time that daily RSI or obv has been this high was the last run up to $22 with the reverse merger dividend speculation.\n\nOBV has only been this high since the very tippy top of the peak. (this indicates that while price has been driven down the volume of the red days is being outweighed by the volume of the green days. This means that people have diamond hands. The idea of OBV is that price movements with low volume are much less significant than the same price movement on high volume.\n\nRSI: Last time RSI closed at this level on the uptrend (61.85) was on may 28th. May 28th had a closing price almost identical of our closing price today. This day also marked the beginning of the runup to $22.\n\nwe have a closing price and RSI to match the beginning of the runup however our OBV is already as high as it was at the peak.... this indicates to me that we have a very likely probability that this run up will be more violent and has more power behind it than the previous run up.\n\nThis is the sort of technical analysis that many professional traders would use to enter what they would call a high conviction trade setup. Most would enter here with a price target of $22 and a stop loss of $3.70 and never look again until the either the price target or stop loss was reached.\n\nlastly the candlestick pattern is bullish as hell. we have a bullish engulfing on friday, monday met with high resistance and insane volume, my guess is market makers delta hedged their $5 calls they have sold and proceded to short the price immediately after. Today leaves us a bullish hammer.\n\nI think we will see a few high volume days met with quite a bit of short fire power but it should be obvious as to the direction of the price. No one can be sure but because of the monday volume i would guess the $5,$6 calls have been delta hedged at this point therefore we likely wont breakout completely until we push over $8 with volume. $8 strike calls has a ton of open interest and i highly doubt those calls have been hedged.\n\nIm betting now, we see a price real close to $8 by end of the week and next week we breakout.</td>

      <td>ARK Investment Management is looking to debut a new ETF that will focus on transparency in companies and shun vice and sectors that run afoul of Environmental, Social and Governance  investing like fossil fuels.\n\nIn an SEC filing, Cathie Wood's shop outlines the fund, which looks to be at least 80% invested in stocks in its benchmark Transparency Index, published by Solactive.\n\n"Companies operating in the following industries, as determined by the Index provider, are excluded from the Index: (i) alcohol, (ii) banking, (iii) chemicals, (iv) confectionary, (v) fossil fuel transportation, (vi) gambling, (vii) metals, (viii) mineral, (ix) natural gas, (x) oil, and (xi) tobacco," ARK says in its filing.\n\nIf approved, the ETF would be the second that Ark has launched this year. In March, the company started a fund focused on space-related investments, which has risen about 4% since its debut and now has more than $600 million in assets. Meanwhile, the firm’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up to $22.5 billion, although it’s down 2% year-to-date -- compared with a gain of more than 20% for the S&amp;amp;P 500.</td>

      <td>by now you've seen the 18% jump from today, and you're wondering, is it too late? did I miss the SKLZ boat? well as of now, no, you ain't missed it. we've barely tasted the first real morsel of an amazing play. Anything below $15 is still probably good.\n\n**first, wtf is SKLZ?** By now we don't have the luxury to throw thousands of your mom's cash at deep OTM calls on any insane combination of "e" and "cummerce." Aunt cathy has been proven not always right, and we've all had our assholes expanded by the 2021 markets. So some actual DD to see if this is a good company is required.\n\nSKLZ is a competitive e-gaming infrastructure provider. Meaning it has built and maintains the back-end for arranging tournaments, cash prizes, logistics, all that jazz for when you want to see if you can beat some other internet stranger at Blackout Bingo. Or literally any other of the 150+ games released or in active development on the SKLZ platform, including Big Buck Hunter (now up to #5 on App Store Sports Games chart), or the upcoming NFL branded games (yes, a legit partnership). You put in a little money to compete, and you can win actual cash for beating other strangers. \n\nIt's as addictive as it sounds, and there's a lot of regulation and legal stuff around it, which SKLZ also takes care of completely. They have algorithms that determine if a game is skill-based or chance, and they have sexy lawyers that take state policy makers out to drinks and let them think they're gonna get their willy's wet.\n\nWhat this means is 2 things: \n\n*(1) SKLZ is a legit strong business in a hugely growing, addictive area of revenue driving mobile gaming,* and \n\n*(2) the majority of boomer investors, firms, and analysts don't understand this company at all. They bot deep OTM calls that died along with all other spacs. Just imagine jim cramer trying to understand anything this company does. Now you see our advantage.*\n\n**So here's the good stuff:**\n\n* From Q2 2020 to Q2 2021, the most brutal comp known to man, SKLZ did amazing in still growing revenue despite re-opening. 2019 Rev was $120M, 2020 Revenue was $230M, and 2021 Rev projected to be $389MM, based off the recent Q2 Earnings call. That's a large double-digit growth %.\n\n* SKLZ has no debt, around $700M in cash, and the CEO said they had runway for 7(!!!) more years, meaning lots of room to acquire new customers, grow product portfolio, acquire new companies, etc. etc.\n\n* CEO Andrew Paradise has a great name, eats tacos when his stock goes up 20% (like tonight), oh, and also successfully built and sold an e-commerce company previously to Intuit\n\n* Lockup terms with blank check "Flyin Eaglet" (altered to pass filter ban) includes a 24-month lock-out, so no DASH put action until December 2022, and btw major partners include Harry Sloan (Former MGM CEO) and Jeff Sagansky (Former CBS CEO)\n\n* While there's a SHIT-TON of SKLZ-backed games in development, the new games are NOT INCLUDED in future earnings guidance... so if Big Buck Hunter, or new NFL game, or one of the other 150+ new and upcoming games is a hit, we'll be swimming in tendies like a hound in a chicken coop\n\n* Lots of institutional ownership from Morgan Stanley, ARK Invest, and some others funds with names like "Wildcat" and "Atlas" that i guess probably sounded cool in 1978\n\n* Bears r gey and some idiot short seller produced a report a few months ago saying the SKLZ was lying when they had a presser that highlighted the new NFL partnership. spoiler alert, SKLZ wasn't lying, and the short seller is fuct.\n\n* Related to above, short interest somewhere between 20-40%, depending where you look and how current the data is, which isn't big squeeze potential, but means the float is lower and the stock can move pretty fast\n\n* All the SPAC warrants expired 2 weeks ago, and liability is off the books\n\n**The ugly?**\n\n* People who don't like growth stock valuations think that $10/share is still overvalued based on EV/rev, etc., and that it's not making a profit yet. SKLZ could be making a profit NOW, but they're choosing to invest and grow. That's the whole idea.\n\n* SKLZ is spending a lot on new customer acquisition costs, but I think this is temporary. As new games come on board, and game studios do their own marketing for the titles (remember, SKLZ is the competitive backbone, and not the developer) I think this should go down\n\n* Currently 3 games from 2 studios account for 79% of revenue, which is bad. But again, 150+ new games being developed and released all the time, and those new games revenues are NOT INCLUDED in future earnings guidance. Take a look at the new games and find them on the App store, and evaluate for yourself whether this is an ongoing risk or not.\n\nI didn't take SKLZ seriously for a while for aforementioned reasons, probably related to Cathy's god-fearing titties, but after getting deep deep into this company, I see huge potential. Yes, there are companies who will want to buy SKLZ. Yes, there are many, many games in development. And yes, this is company that is growing *extremely* fast.\n\nI called AMC at $3 and some other shit, and I don't really care if you listen, but I think this is a really freakin strong play and I'm getting too old to not have a sauna in my house. I need to make cash money.\n\n**I'm long 1200 shares since early August with 11.68 cost basis.** If I hadn't lost so much money already on deep OTM calls between February and June, I'd be putting a lot more on the table. Trust me. Lil Jack agrees, in fact I might have given him the idea. Check my comment history. \n\n*God speed, retards.*</td>

While Tesla's net profit margin is 9.55%, Baba's is at 21.91%. These market caps should be flipped. Tesla has a net income of 1.14 Billion and Baba has a net income of 21 Billion.

They do pretty much everything.\n\nCorsair has acquired several companies the last 3 years: ScuffGaming, Origin, GamersSensei, Elgato, Visuals By Impulse....\n\nAll that's left is to enter the mobile gaming world and they will literally dominate the entire gaming market. And seeing their pace of acquisitions, I'm sure they will sooner or later.\n\nThe company is focusing lately on the streaming world (elgato, Visuals By Impulse), which as I'm sure you all know, is growing at an unstoppable pace, competing head to head with traditional television. It is only a matter of time before it becomes the most popular way to consume content.\n\nIt is also looking to improve its service and subscription revenues (ICUE).\n\nIn the last few months alone they have launched 84 products, shipped 33 million around the world and acquired 3 new companies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1pfyp61vink71.png?width=1865&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=551d205ac2be82b9957d72b3122eea1feb340bef\n\nThey are expanding very aggressively, and currently sell products in 26 categories:\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bgivrap5jnk71.png?width=2126&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=54decbc4db9edf04e461d8c399cb91ec3898fcdd\n\nThey have some of the largest communities of all video game brands:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n5tj29fajnk71.png?width=2153&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cd9a8f86b39f82507fcc676535f9c711f21b829f\n\nAll of its segments are growing at an astounding rate, but as you can see, the content creators segment is simply incredible. Elgato has a virtual monopoly in the capture, spotlight, streamdeck, green screen and they have just launched a facecam that is getting very good sales.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3z1m6txgjnk71.png?width=2224&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=176d3133b42aeaafbca8e71adee6fd8b57e84890\n\nThese spectacular results have been achieved at a rather adverse time.\n\nShipping costs have risen dramatically due to inflation, especially for container shipments from China.\n\nChip shortages have also been a big problem and, let's not forget, corsair has a leading position in ram memory, power supplies, magnetic levitation fans, RGB... and nowadays it is very expensive to buy a graphics card. Which has prevented many people from building their own computers.\n\nWe also come from a period of pandemic, many people thought that its sales were going to plummet, but in spite of all this, it has produced very good results.\n\nTL;DR\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bficnarjknk71.png?width=919&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b1f537f44e3f0af2704073175ea1b73c87bc947a\n\nI do have 500 Shares and few 9/17 30 Calls.</td>

      <td>Hey guys what is up?   \n\n\nToday I wanted to bring to your attention the MACD in general, using Wallstreets love/hate child, and my favorite stock, Gamestop $GME.  \n   \n**MACD: Moving Average Convergence Divergence :** Lemme break it down for you. You got two lines. One Blue(short term outlook) One Orange(Longer term outlook)When they cross or diverge significantly that can send a signal for a trader to enter or exit a trade. Here is an example from investopedia.  \n\n\n \n\n[When the blue line\(short term sentiment\) crosses the long term a sell off is occurring. When the blue line crosses going upwards recent sentiment is bullish and generally lots of buying happens until they cross or get near again. How fast the blue line breaks away from the orange line determines how bullish or bearish recent sentiment is.\(The lines on the price chart are the 20 ema and Vwap I believe, investopedia has it unlabeled.\)](https://preview.redd.it/j271wzrywrk71.png?width=6146&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e75d828f7da491436e692237af8f70da134fc8ec)\n\nNow here is an example of the MACD  last time GME was at this level($210-220) before running to 350 in early June.   \n\n\n[On the bottom you use a Green Donut. The outer crust of the donut shows a slight dip below long term sentiment before crossing again and taking off! The top donut shows the slight dip in price when macD crossed. Now lets compare to right now!](https://preview.redd.it/ncs9xqplxrk71.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a652bf759d63144cff3bb4169c7430c89ca8497a)\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n[As you can see the blue line crossed the orange line downward and we had a small dip in price proceeding a strong close. If you see the blue line cross the orange line back upwards and break away prepare for a rip!](https://preview.redd.it/65myefeayrk71.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b1dc8efbcf7e38f299abd748d414df7bb1af8a05)\n\nAbove are the 30 minute time frames because they will be most applicable if you are looking to buy say tomorrow morningish. But here is the daily chart which paints a much clearer picture of buy and sell zones stricly using macD. Also will be comparing it to APPL.   \n\n\n[Buy and sell zones for gme over the last 6 months just using MacD. The Daily MacD has not been this bullish for 3 months.](https://preview.redd.it/qvfp3q34rsk71.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5c823716cbebc3d91c5b8a54c2b841add085acf1)\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n[Appl for comparison. ](https://preview.redd.it/l24u2tcorsk71.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c504f118d0b2ca30009306c7b5bf79a445490af7)\n\nLastly I just want to mention some other indicators you should look at/pay attention to as well. RSI, 50EMA, and Vwap. Here is an article to Benzinga that is bullish even though RSI is hot(anything above 50 or 60 depends who you talk to is overbought and below 50-40 is oversold.) [https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/08/22745579/why-gamestop-stock-looks-ready-to-break-out](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/08/22745579/why-gamestop-stock-looks-ready-to-break-out)  \n\n\nTLDR: None of this is financial advice. When lines cross buy or sell. If you see the blue line cross the orange line upwards really fast within the next 16 days expect a rip to follow. If the blue line drops below the orange line fast a sell off is occurring. You can apply MacD to most stocks, but it is a lagging indicator and no technical indicator is perfect I recommend using multiple to reaffirm whatever your thesis is. BULLISH GME$$$  \n\n\nWhy 16 days? To rub my nutsack all over these guys faces, not because I hate them, but because I know they will enjoy it  when GME rips!!  \n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p6gd93/making\_money\_by\_inversing\_wsb\_stonks/h9d9pj7/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p6gd93/making_money_by_inversing_wsb_stonks/h9d9pj7/?context=3)  \n\n\nPositions: \n\n[POGGERS](https://preview.redd.it/5i12vqq3tsk71.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fe43978a45c4d83760c6ecb83797d4216ee275df)</td>

      <td>**TLDR: Buy puts on Lucid at open tomorrow.**  \n\n\nMany of you may have heard of Lucid motors. ‘The next Tesla’ Cramer calls it. Maybe that will be true in 10 years, maybe it won’t be. Cramer certainly wasn't right about Tesla 10 years ago, so is he right now? My pea sized brain can’t give you an answer to that, what I can tell you however, is how to harness your repressed inner 🌈🐻 to go from Ramenistan to Tendie Town. \n\n**What’s the rundown on Lucid?**  \nLucid recently went public through a merger deal, and in doing so, they raised funding from a ‘PIPE’. Pipe (Private Investment in Public Equity) basically means that big banks and hedge funds get the chance to buy into this merger deal at an agreed upon price, often below market price, but are subject to a lockup period.  \n\n\n[Lucid's PIPE Agreement](https://preview.redd.it/8hgiv750lsk71.jpg?width=1144&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a1951cd88749c4a7b957d945fe6af0b1e51001b4)\n\n**So what?**  \nThis lockup period is set to end tomorrow, which means that 166,666,667 (166 ⅔ Million shares for those of you who can’t read) are available to be sold tomorrow. Granted, not all of the holders of them will sell, but a good portion will be sold. Furthermore, PIPE investors have been restricted from hedging their positions in any way, shape or form. This means no buying puts and no shorting shares. Given these PIPE investors bought in at a price of $15, it’s not unreasonable to expect a lot of them to take profits.   \n**Who is in the PIPE?**   \n Some Lucid shareholders (bagholders) will scream that the pipe has fundamental holders, and that they won't sell. Though there are *some* long term holders in it, there are a lot of hedge fund’s in the mix too. These guys are simply in for a short term play, and will be happy to get out with 33% gains.   \n\n\n[Let's play a game, Bagholder Bingo!](https://preview.redd.it/azcqxt2dlsk71.png?width=960&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d3300ce52df8859e24e8e68d42798f33a4e155fe)\n\n  \n**Positions?**   \nI am currently long 64 September 17th $20 Puts. If you want to play with fire, buy September 3rd puts. These can multibag, but come with a lot more risk.   \n\n\n[Positions in Lucid](https://preview.redd.it/53zzhmpjlsk71.png?width=951&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=67d7d497c434dbb77984a3c16258f48cafa3df6d)</td>

      <td>Alright degenerates, you know Bed Bath and Beyond? That store you always go to to buy things for your wife so she might actually sleep with you for once in her life? Yeah... Well it turns out BBBY is far from dead and has successfully rebranded itself into an undervalued e-commerce giant poised for massive future growth!\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Fundamentals:**\n\nDespite being in the middle of a digital transformation from a retail store into an e-commerce giant while dealing with a global pandemic and supply-chain shocks, BBBY has managed to grow at a rapid pace while maintaining stable gross margins and a strong balance sheet\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nnxg5ly14pk71.png?width=903&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b50b848b70a3d734333fdd7e45d3abfea7445184\n\nIn Q1 2021, BBBY experienced 49.5% revenue growth while still increasing their gross margins to 32.4% through streamlining their operations. Additionally, their past 4 quarters of online sales have all had consecutive sales growth, breaking the seasonal trend and showing a great movement towards ecommerce\n\nQ2 should be even better for them as they have continued streamlining operations and expect to post over 2B in revenue\n\nBBBY has over 1.2 BILLION dollars of cash on-hand which they can use to continue moving towards e-commerce, create in-house products, and keep up growth. That cash alone is 40% of their ENTIRE market cap, not even including additional assets.\n\nManagement has seen how undervalued their company is and has repurchased $130m of shares to take advantage of this, with more share purchases to come. This shows how strong of a position they are in and how confident management is that their stock will increase in the future.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/roim01484pk71.png?width=1249&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=678d71fd485768434f1a2f6a50d0b97a98c0f768\n\nEven though they are focusing on growth instead of profitability right now, BBBY’s P/E ratio is STILL in line with the S@P 500 average\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nOk... now that you understand how undervalued this company is, let me introduce to you the management\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Management:**\n\nManagement is one of, if not the most important factors for how well a company will do, and BBBY has some of the best management a company could hope for\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nMark Tritton, the current CEO, has had over 30 years of experience in retail and oversaw Target’s streamlining and digital transformation as Executive VP. He has a clear vision for the company and has the industry connections and know-how to get it done\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nGustavo Arnal, the current CFO, has had experience turning around struggling companies before, most notably Avon. He has experience leading WBA’s global division and can help the company reach international markets\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nJohn Hartmann, the current COO, has had experience being the CEO of True Value Company which focused on hardwear. He also has experience working in Home Depot’s digital transformation program. He can help BBBY create some products of their own while guiding this digital push\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are many more amazing people on the leadership team, but these 3 are the ones who stand out to me due to their unique abilities in certain fields\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nManagement is what creates and directs a company’s visions and operations. With these 3 people on their team, BBBY covers all needed areas; Digital transformation, global supply-chains, hardwear production, and financial streamlining\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Shorts:**\n\nDespite being in such a good position, BBBY still has a 23% short interest left over from the whole meme stock surge in January(edited)\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vw8ucdd4pk71.png?width=1796&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f59847892b2ab7babafd50d3d2275c3b07caa6d7\n\nThis is not enough to cause a squeeze, but what it has been doing for the past few months is providing a price floor (at around 26$) and upward momentum as shorts take the loss and move on.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Meme stocks:**  \n\nMy play is based around the fundamentals of the company, but meme stocks are so closely correlated that it makes sense to mention them\n\nPrice action with BBBY has been closely correlated with other meme stocks since the January squeeze. If my theory is correct and meme stocks have a resurgence, we could see BBBY mooning again\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ub0opfck4pk71.png?width=1352&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=54c47d9edcfa08ab601610c1c877b5dbc7171a61\n\n**This play is more about how undervalued the company is, but if you believe that there will be a new meme stock cycle then buying short dated calls could work. The call options have such low open interest that they are trading way below what they should be**\n\n**Positions:**\n\n120 Shares, 25 30c 9/3, 25 29.5 9/10, 10 30c 9/17\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nBBBY is undervalued and overshorted. This provides a great long term play as the company keeps doing better and shorts keep closing their positions\n\nIf you believe there will be a new meme stock supercycle, there are plenty of cheap options you can purchase too.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT: Since you Retards don't like to read heres a simple picture.**\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u7kzpo9isqk71.png?width=573&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1517791851ae71bdd9610b7a5e072ac8f931c916</td>

If we take AST management's 2030 EBIDTA of more than $16 billion and apply a 10x multiple (which we think is still conservative given the business' expected growth profile), this implies a 2030 enterprise value of $163 billion (vs $2 billion today). Discounting that EV back to present time at a 15% discount yields a share price of roughly $190 today."**\n\n# Risk\n\n* Does tech actually work? AST has shown through a prototype satellite previously that connected via 4G-LTE on the ground, but at large production/commercial size, won't know for sure until BW3 launches.\n* Major delay in launch/testing. A few days/weeks delay due purely to launch provider/bad weather issues is fine, but if AST says they are delaying due to tech issue or they are not ready, that would not be good. They are launching via SpaceX rocket which has a very high success rate, so launch provider is not a major concern.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n*The above is my own personal opinion and should not be used as investment advice.

And this is a growth company not some conservative boomer play and it is trading under value which is rare to see in this market with how expensive growth is. \n\nThis stock is a **great business with great metrics and catalysts for growth and is undervalued from a fundamental standpoint.** I exited a while ago when it was in the 30 ranges but now that it is at 28 after being at a 52 week high of almost 38$ per share this is a great time to buy into a company where everything else is at all time highs. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xvvihi5hrtk71.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c94d31c0d8f46b83da97be6ee880858ff81f1690\n\n**Earnings Update:** Some new updates since my last post on Callaway golf. They crushed expectations for its second-quarter profits. Non-GAAP per-share earnings came in at 36 cents, while analysts had expected just a penny. Revenue came in at $914 million, topping analyst expectations for $755 million.  This was driven by a 91% increase in golf-equipment sales compared with the corresponding period last year, Callaway (ticker: ELY) notched a 97% year-over-year increase in revenue across all of its business lines except for[ ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/callaway-nears-deal-to-buy-rest-of-topgolf-11603816074)Topgolf portion. \n\nThe Topgolf portion which accounts for 36% of revenue, posted solid numbers, management reported that same-venue sales are still recovering and currently are around 90% of the 2019 level. This is HUGE and once all covid mandates international and domestic are lifted and people are fully comfortable, they will blow past 2019 numbers especially with the growth Topgolf has made in previous years.\n\n For the next quarter, management is expecting revenue to come in between $775 million and $790 million. That would be less than the $914 million for the most recent quarter, but attributes this to seasonal factors mean the second quarter is generally stronger than the third. \n\n**CEO said -**  “While in the short term we will experience some lingering supply constraints and other challenges caused by the pandemic, we believe that these challenges will be manageable given current demand levels and actions we are taking to mitigate the impact,” he said. \n\n**What this means and why we are getting in at a good time** \-  Quarter guidance may appear low, but shows that he believes management’s call reflects supply-chain troubles rather than problems with demand. Investors may seem a bit weary and nervous which has probably led to the dip in the stock price recently and is more of an investor psychology then the actual business. \n\n**What the professionals on Wall Street are saying - 5 analysts say it is a buy, 1 says it is a hold, 0 sells.** Lowest price target is 32.50....average is 40.92......highest is 49.00 That leaves a lot of room for tendies. I love trades where I can yolo and and be backed by fundamentals and backed by people who do this for a living and speak with management one on one. Because smart money combined with my yolo money is a great recipe for lambos.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n[Callaway in autist language is \\"Tendies\\"](https://preview.redd.it/8nhd5dclptk71.png?width=750&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=46965d526d6460387f05ebb33b8d76b147072d90)\n\n**What's the play?:** Time to capitalize off of any uncertainty of Callaway from investors and the slow price movement the last six months in preparation for the run up for next earnings report which should blow consensus harder then a gay bear behind Arby's and blow company guidance away as well as people realize more and more Callaway had a great acquisition of Topgolf and golf is growing with the population. Plus the PE ratio, earnings, company from a macro perspective is a fucking no brainer. It's time to buy the dip. \n\n\-**28$ Calls are dirt fucking cheap for January 15th at around 3.00$ and they are already in the money......if you want a true yolo get some 32$ calls and let them rideeeee.** \n\n**-Shares...great long term hold and if you have ever been to a fucking topgolf with your wife and her boyfriend you'll know how awesome of a place it is to get cucked.** \n\nI entered the 28$ calls \n\nLiterally cannot go tits up 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</td>

This helps sportsbook like Draftkings provide live prop bets like "Will the Person Strike Out in this At Bat?"

Pair this was an upcoming earnings reports and $GENI could see a crazy run into the start of the NFL season and 9/8 earnings report for this quarter.\n\n# Earnings on 9/8\n\n$GENI reports earnings on September 8th pre-market. $GENI has a huge MOAT and an exclusive deal with the NFL. Growth is fantastic, 120% EBITDA 2020-2022. $GENI has only scratched the surface as majority of revenue is from sports betting at the moment. Currently $GENI gets 2% of a cut as their take rate from sportsbooks. They are looking to increase this to 10%. Even if they were to increase this to 5%, this would give them major profit increases which will lead to faster industry growth. \n\n# $DKNG has a possible deal with ESPN worth $3B. $GENI and $DKNG move close together.\n\nAccording to great DD from /u/WLSRTJP : $DKNG and ESPN may have a massive partnership coming that would allow for investors to see a volatile move upwards in share price similar to $AMZN and $AFRM. \n\nSource: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pf6u0h/espn\_and\_dkng\_partnership\_announcing\_soon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pf6u0h/espn_and_dkng_partnership_announcing_soon/)\n\nDeal Summary: [https://twitter.com/kingtutspacs/status/1431331154494373890?s=21](https://twitter.com/kingtutspacs/status/1431331154494373890?s=21)\n\n#</td>
